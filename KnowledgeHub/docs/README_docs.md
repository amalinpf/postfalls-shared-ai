# NITRO Documentation (Consolidated Manual)

This folder will contain the **structured NITRO manual**, consolidating information from:

- `/kb-html` (exported KB pages currently live on GitHub Pages)  
- `/supplemental` (internal notes and DOCX files)  
- Crow Canyonâ€™s official online help  

---

## Status
ðŸš§ Work in progress.  
Right now, the published site still points to `/kb-html`. Once this manual is ready, GitHub Pages can be updated to serve from `/docs`.

---

## Goals
- Organize functions, workflows, custom actions, and examples into clear sections.  
- Reduce duplication between KB pages and internal notes.  
- Provide inline links to both GitHub Pages content and Crow Canyonâ€™s official manual.  
- Act as the **single reference** for Post Falls ITâ€™s use of NITRO.

---

## Temporary Access
For now, continue to use the existing references:  

- [Current GitHub Pages site (`/kb-html`)](https://amalinpf.github.io/postfalls-nitro-reference/)  
- [Crow Canyon NITRO Online Manual](https://www.crowcanyon.info/nitro/appmanual_v2/index.html?nitro-studio.html)
