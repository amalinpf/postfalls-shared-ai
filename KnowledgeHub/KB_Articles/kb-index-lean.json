    "text": " Missing Attachments in SharePoint Tickets Missing Attachments in SharePoint Tickets 1542 views Less than a minute 0 Attachments on emails sent to a SharePoint list could be missing. This can especially be an issue for attachments on emails sent from Office Outlook for Mac and Outlook Web Access. Are attachments missing from e-mail messages that are sent to a SharePoint document library? If attachments are missing from e-mail messages that are sent to a SharePoint Server 2010 document library, it might be because you associated the document library with an e-mail address. When you do this, Directory Management Service may not add the following two attributes: · internet Encoding = 1310720 · mAPIRecipient = false You must use Active Directory Service Interfaces (ADSI) to manually add these two missing attributes. Note: On servers that are running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2008 R2, ADSI Edit is installed when you install the AD DS role to make a server a domain controller. You can also install Windows Server 2008 Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT) on domain member servers or stand-alone servers. For more information, see Installing or Removing the Remote Server Administration Tools Pack 8 ( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=143345 ). To add attributes by using ADSI Edit Click Start , and then click Run . In the Run dialog box, type Adsiedit.msc , and then click OK . In the ADSI Edit window, expand ADSI Edit , expand Domain [DomainName] , expand DC=DomainName, DC=com , and then expand CN=Users . Right-click the user name to which you want to add the missing attributes, and then click Properties . In the Properties dialog box, double-click internet Encoding on the Attribute Editor tab. In the Integer Attribute Editor dialog box, type 1310720 in the Value box, and then click OK . In the Properties dialog box, double-click mAPIRecipient on the Attribute Editor tab. In the Boolean Attribute Editor dialog box, click False , and then click OK two times. "

How to manage the List View Threhsold in SharePoint On-Premises? 973 views 1 min , 16 sec read 0 Applies To: SharePoint On Premises Issue with List View Threshold Limit: Description: By default the List View Threshold limit in SharePoint Central Administration is 5000 items. If the list is having more than 5000 items then it will exceeds the list view threshold limit and will show the “List View threshold error message” in views. To avoid this error message, we can increase the list view threshold limit in SharePoint Central Administration, Creating indexed columns in list and creating filtered views using indexed columns. Detailed Steps: 1. Increase the list view threshold limit in Sharepoint Central Administration. Go to SharePoint Central Administration –> Application Management –> Manage Web Applications –> Select the web application and click on “Resource Throttling” under general settings as shown below. Increase the list view threshold limit 2. However there might be performance issues when the list view threshold is increased to a larger value. Other possible way is to index the SharePoint list columns and create filtered views with indexed columns in the filter conditions. To create indexed columns, go to List Settings –> click on Indexed Columns and create a new indexed column as shown below Select the column and click ok. 3. Now create a filtered view using indexed column. We have created a sample view Tickets 2018 which shows all the tickets created in 2018.   Issue with Lookup Threshold Limit:   This error can appear when there are too many lookup columns in the given view of the list. The standard SharePoint limit is 8 lookup columns in any given view. There are two ways to fix this. One is to reduce the number of lookup columns in the view. However, if you need more than 8 lookup columns in your view you’ll need to increase the throttle limit for lookup columns:         Open SharePoint Central Administration, Go to Application Management –> Manage Web Applications Click to select the web application that hosts your list (eg. SharePoint – 80) In the Ribbon, select General Settings/Resource Throttling In the List View Lookup Threshold limit, edit the value you want (for example, 16 instead of the default 8). Click OK to save it.     To know more about indexing the columns in different lists to increase the performance, please refer https://www.crowcanyon.help/article/243 "

Issue: The SharePoint application pulls in Mobile Phone Number of the Requester in the Requester Phone field on the Ticket, when the Work Phone is what is expected or required. Cause: In SharePoint, the User Profile’s phone number field is by default the Mobile Phone Number (which is pulled in from Active Directory when the user is created). Possible solutions: 1. Change the SharePoint user profile field mappings in Central Administration by using User Profile Synchronization service. (User Profile Synchronization service is available only in Standard/Enterprise version of SharePoint 2010)      Note: Any change made by User Profile Synchro nization service will apply to all sites in your SharePoint farm. 2.

How do I set permissions so that end users can submit and update tickets, but can’t see the Service Area? 985 views 1 min , 49 sec read 0 Setting permissions requires having users in the correct SharePoint groups in order to permission the groups accordingly. First, you’ll want to define a SharePoint Group that contains your end users. This could be a group that contains an All Domain Users AD group. Also, you may want to define a new Permission Level such as Contribute without Delete in order to remove the ability for users to delete Tickets. To set Permission Levels, please see this technet article: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc721640%28v=office.15%29.aspx. The article refers to SharePoint 2013, but there is an option on the site to select the articles for SharePoint 2007 and SharePoint 2010. NOTE: Before proceeding to the next steps, make sure that the person who is configuring these permissions and any other users who require access to the Service Area are in a separate SharePoint Group. This group or these groups will retain their access. However, if the users are not in a separate SharePoint Group, their access will also be removed for the Service Area. Once you have your SharePoint Group and Permission Level defined, go to the top level of the service area: For SP 2010, navigate to Site Actions in the upper left corner of the screen and select Site Permissions:   For SP 2013, navigate to the gear icon in the upper right corner of the screen and select Site Settings:     Then select Site Permissions under Users and Permissions:   In either version, click Stop Inheriting Permissions:   2010: 2013:   Select the SharePoint Group which contains your end users, and then click Remove User Permissions:   2010: 2013: This will now prevent your end users from accessing the Service Area. The next steps will allow the end users to submit and update Tickets only. There are several lists within the Service Area to which end users will need either Read or Contribute (without Delete) access in order to submit and update Tickets. Open up the Calendar list, and navigate to the permissions section for this list. The easiest way to do this is to go to View All Site Content (2010, under Site Actions) or Site Contents (2013, under the gear icon). Click on the given list or library name. At the top, there is a List ribbon. Open this ribbon and click List Settings on the right-hand side: 2010: 2013:   In both 2010 and 2013, choose “Permissions for this list” under the Permissions and Managment section:   Follow the steps above to break inheritance from the parent site. Then choose Grant Permissions to give Read permissions back to the end users. In 2010, select the Group in the Users/Groups section. Select Grant users permission directly. Then choose the Read permission. Uncheck the Send welcome e-mail to the new users (unless you want to send an email to all end users):   In 2013, select the Group in the Invite People section. Click Show Options to choose whether to send an email invitation or not and to select the permission level being granted: Repeat the above steps for each list and library which need to be modifed. The following is the list of lists, and the access required: Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE Read only lists and libraries: 1. Calendar 2. Category 3. Configurations 4. Issue type 5.

Please follow the below steps to configure this report using the Crow Canyon Report App.   Create a calculated column of type Text called “Week Number” on ‘Tickets’ list, using the following formula Go to list settings and Create a new Calculated Column with formula: =IF(INT(([Created]-DATE(YEAR([Created]),1,1)+(TEXT(WEEKDAY(DATE(YEAR([Created]),1,1)-1),”d”)))/7)=0,52,INT(([Created]-DATE(YEAR([Created]),1,1)+(TEXT(WEEKDAY(DATE(YEAR([Created]),1,1)-1),”d”)))/7)) Above formula will get the week number (1 to 52). If you want to prefix the week number with a text say ‘Week-‘ then use the below formula instead: =CONCATENATE(“Week-“,TEXT(IF(INT((Created-DATE(YEAR(Created),1,1)+(TEXT(WEEKDAY(DATE(YEAR(Created),1,1)-1),”d”)))/7)=0,52,INT((Created-DATE(YEAR(Created),1,1)+(TEXT(WEEKDAY(DATE(YEAR(Created),1,1)-1),”d”)))/7)),”0″)) You can replace the date column in above formula by replacing all instances of ‘Created’ with some other date field name.   Save it as a ‘Single Line of Text’ column.   Create a view on the list to get items from a specific period   Here we are creating a View called ‘Tickets by Year’ on ‘Tickets’ list to get all items created in year 2016. Fiter the Items in the View as shown in the below picture.     Create Report to show items by Week Navigate to Crow Canyon Reports App. You can click ‘Manage Reports’ in Crow Canyon Report Centre.

Open Crow Canyon Workflow Manager App and configure a workflow on source list item modified event as shown below. (You can open Crow Canyon Workflow Manager App from Application Administration, Crow Canyon Apps page or directly open from S ite Contents )     This action will copy item to \"IT Standard\" service area. Similarly, add more actions if Ticket could be transferred to other Service Areas as well.   4. If you want to close the source Ticket, then add an action as per below steps Add an ‘Update Item’ action in the above workflow. Select ‘Current Item’ as the item to update and configure the field mapping as shown:  $strcat(Ticket got transferred to, ,[TransferTo], ,site)] 5. If you want to send mail on Ticket Transfer then configure ‘Send an Email’ action in the same workflow.   Staff can now easily transfer the Tickets from one service area to another. For this they can edit the Ticket item and set ‘TranserTo’ column value to that of desired service area. For e.g. if we edit a Ticket from Source list and select ‘Standard’ option in ‘TransferTo’ choice column then a copy of that Ticket will get created in target site and the source Ticket will get Closed.    Ticket created in target site:     "

Ticket is to be responded in the given time otherwise an action (send mail, etc.) can be performed for that Ticket. How to determine whether a ticket is responded or not? In this example, we take two different actions as response indication. 1. First reply (Outgoing email) from the Ticket       a. Crow Canyon Advanced Email App needs to be used to send outgoing email from a Ticket 2. Work Log field update       a.  Edit ticket, enter Work Log field information, save   Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE Implementation: When a ticket is created, Workflow Manager App handles that event and sets the Response Due field on the Ticket. There are 2 different configurations needed to implement the Response Due feature 1. List Schema Updates 2. Configure Workflows using Workflow Manager App List Schema Updates: Create columns in Tickets list if not already present 1.Field Name: Response Due    Field Type: Date and Time    Default Value: None 2.Field Name: Responded    Field Type: Yes/No    Default Value: No 3.Field Name: Responded Date    Field Type: Date and Time    Default Value: None   Workflow Manager Configurations: Configure workflows on Tickets, Email Tickets lists using CrowCanyon Workflow Manager App as described below. Workflow1: Configure workflow on ‘Tickets’ List This workflow sets the ‘Response Due’ date based on desired conditions. In this example, we are setting Response Due to 4 hours from created time if the Ticket’s category is “Email”. Create a workflow on Tickets list, “item created” event   Create “Update Item” Action This action will set the ‘Response Due’ date to four hours from the ticket created time Configure the Update Item action as shown in below screenshots Formula: $add([Created],0:4:0:0) Note: If there is another existing workflow configured to set “Due Date” at the time of ticket creation, same workflow actions can be used to set the Response Due as well.   Workflow2: Configure workflow on ‘Tickets’ list This workflow marks a Ticket as responded and updates “Responded Time” when work log is updated only if the Ticket is not already marked as responded. Create a workflow on Tickets list, “item modified” event Create “Update Item” Action This action will mark the Ticket as responded and updates the responded time in to “Responded Date” field if the ticket is not already marked as responded. Configure the Update Item action as shown in below screenshots   Workflow3: Configure workflow on ‘Email Tickets’ List This workflow marks a Ticket as responded and captures the responded time when an outgoing mail is sent from a Ticket. Create a workflow on Email Tickets list, “an item is created” event Create “Query List” Action This action will check whether the ticket from which an outgoing email is sent is already marked as responded or not. Further actions in this workflow will be executed only if the ticket is not already responded. Configure the query list action as shown in below screenshots Query: <View><Query><Where><And><Eq><FieldRef Name=\"Responded\" /><Value Type=\"Boolean\">1</Value></Eq><Eq> <FieldRef Name=’ID’ /><Value Type=’Number’>##RelatedTicketID##</Value></Eq></And></Where></Query></View> Create “Update Item” Action This action will updates the ‘Responded’ column to true and ‘Responded Date’ with the modified date. Configure update item action as shown in below screenshots Note: This update item action will update the Responded, Responded Date fields only if the ticket is not already marked as Responded. Mail Template1: Configure Mail Template on ‘Tickets’ List Go to Crow Canyon Workflow Manager App, create a Mail template on ‘Tickets’ list as shown in below screenshots Note: This is just a sample mail template. Mail Subject and Mail Body can be configured as required.   Workflow4: Configure workflow on ‘Tickets’ List This timer workflow is used to execute action(s) if the ticket is not responded in the given time. In this example, we are sending mail to the Assigned Staff/Staff group if the ticket is not marked as responded with in the given Response Due time. Create a workflow on Tickets list, “based on date field in item” event.   Create “Send Mail” Action This action will send mail to user in column ‘Assigned Staff’. Note that the recipient can be anything as per the needs, we have considered Assigned Staff as an example here. Configure the Update Item action as shown in below screenshots Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE "

In this list IT assets can be maintained and in Tickets list there is a lookup to the Assets list. Assets list has ‘Employee’ field for the user to whom the asset is assigned. While creating the Ticket it is convenient to filter the Assets lookup column based on the requester of the Ticket as otherwise it will be difficult to select the right Asset in the Ticket if there are many assets in the system. Pre-requisites Tickets list should have lookup to the Assets list and the column name is “Related Asset” Assets list has a single user Person and Group field with column name “Employee” There should be an index on Employee column in Assets list. Without this index, loading will be slower in the Ticket form. To know more details about how to index a column in SharePoint please refer this article Configuration Steps Upload the script files 1.

It can be configured using our Crow Canyon Workflow Manager App There are two different things to do to configure archival process. 1. Prepare the list schema to move old tickets along with its related items 2. Configure Workflows using Workflow Manager App 1. Prepare List Schema: — Take list templates of Tickets, Email Tickets,Associated Tasks and Time Tracking lists. Go to Site Contents –>Tickets list –>List Settings –>Click on ‘Save list as Template’ link — Give File name,Template Name and click on “Ok” — Create archival lists (Archived Tickets, Archived Email Tickets, Archived Associated Tasks,Archived Time Tracking lists) using these list templates. (The idea behind creating Archived Email Tickets,Arichived Time Tracking and Archived Associated Tasks lists is to move email history and related tasks along with tickets during the archival process). — Creating Archived tickets list: Go to Site Contents –> Add an App –> Select Tickets list Template –> name it as Archived Tickets list. — Similarly create Archived Email Tickets,Archived Time Tracking and Archived Associated Tasks lists using their correspoinding list templates. — Once these Archival lists are created, make sure all the lookup fields in Archived Tickets list, Archived Email Tickets list, Archived Time Tracking list and Archived Associated Tasks list are correct. — Recreate lookup fields in these lists Archived Email Tickets, Archived Time Tracking list and Archived Associated Tasks list. Archived Email Tickets list: Internal name: RelatedTicketID Display name: Related Ticket ID Archived Time Tracking list: I nternal name: TicketID Display name: Related Ticket ID Archived Assoicated Tasks list: Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE Internal name: RelatedTicketID Display name: Related Ticket ID — Linked item columns need to be deleted manually from Archived Tickets list and create pointing to archived related lists using CrowCanyon Linked items App (Optional) Delete Time Tracking, Email History and Associated Tasks fields from Archived Tickets list. — Create these fields in Archived Tickets list using CrowCanyon Linked Items app go to Site Contents –> CrowCanyon Linked Items app –> Create fields like below Field Name: Time Tracking Field Name: Associated Tasks Field Name: Email History — Configure tabs in Archived Tickets list similar to the tabs present in Tickets list using CrowCanyon Forms Manager App (Optional) 2. Configure Workflows using Workflow Manager App: Configure Workflow using Workflow Manager App like below. Go to Application Administration–> Crowcanyon Apps –> Crowcanyon Workflow Manager App Configure a Scheduled Query workflow like shown below. Schedule Query: <View> <Query> <Where> <Leq> <FieldRef Name ='ClosedDate' /> <Value Type='DateTime' > <Today OffsetDays='-365' /> </Value> </Leq> </Where> </Query> </View> Move Item Action: Configure “ Move Action ” like below. Mappings: Archived Associated Tasks –Associated Tasks Archived Email Tickets –Email Tickets Archived Time Tracking –Time Tracking Manual Archival Workflow configuration: Above automatic archival process moves the items only based on the Closed Date rule i.e. exactly 1 year after Closed Date so tickets will be archived timely manner. If we would like to archive the tickets in bulk at a time, we can follow this manual archival process. There are again three different things to configure this: 1. Prepare the list schema to move old tickets along with its related items 2. Configure custom action using Crow Canyon Batch Operations 3. Configure workflows using Workflow Manager App 1. Prepare the list schema to move old tickets along with its related items Same as above automatic archival list schema. In addition, create a new field in tickets list. Create Yes/No field in Tickets list Internal Name: ArchiveTickets Display Name: Archive Tickets 2. Configure custom action using Crow Canyon Batch Operations: Create a batch action using CrowCanyon Common utilities app Go to Site Contents –> CrowCanyon Common utilities app –> Create a new batch action. 3. Configure workflows using Workflow Manager App: Configure Workflow using CrowCanyon Workflow Manager app Goto Site Contents –> CrowCanyon Workflow Manager –> Create new workflow like below Move Item Action: Configure “ Move Item ” action For Man"

    "text": " Configure Survey from Portal in O365 Configure Survey from Portal in O365 3089 views 1 min , 50 sec read 4 Steps to configure Survey from Portal: Crow Canyon Service Request provides a functionality to take feedback from requester on the service provided when the ticket is closed. Our Application has a list in the backend site “Service Satisfaction Survey” that captures the requester feedback information. In this article we use Employee Portal to configure Survey form and use this portal form link in requester notifications. Workflow Manager App will be used to send ticket close notification with portal survey form link. Limitation: SharePoint Survey list has a built-in field type “Rating Scale” which is not supported in our empoyee portal forms, so as a replacement to this rating scale field type, we can create multiple choice or any other simple field types in ‘Service Satisfcation Survey’ list in backend site and create forms in Portal using these fields. Note: If you want to configure Survey functionality with “Rating Scale” field type please refer this article – SurveyOnBackendSite Configure Forms in Portal: 1. As described above we can create multiple fields in ‘Service Satisfaction Survey’ list with simple field types. Here we have created a simple choice field ‘Feedback’ as an example   2. Create a New Form in Portal for ‘Survey’ form by following these steps Open Portal Index/Home page and click on ‘Portal Settings’ link as shown below     Under Portal Forms section, Select Web, List and click “New List Form” button. It will create new Lists form for the Survey list and edit the settings to configure the NITRO forms for the Survey list. Configure the Portal form by drag and drop the columns and then publish the form.   “Related Ticket ID” field in the Survey feedback form will be auto populated during the page load after clicking on the survey link, so make it a read-only field using column permissions in the portal. Select the Related Ticket ID column and configure the read only permission from Column Settings and click Publish the form like shown below   Enable Survey Notifications: In our application on every Ticket completion Requester receives an auto notification which do not include Survey link. To include Survey link in mails on Ticket completion we need to configure mails using Workflow Manager app by disabling auto notifications to requester on Ticket completion. 1. Disable auto notifications to Requester on Ticket Close by following these instructions Open ‘Notification on Ticket Completion’ list from Application Administration under ‘Notifications’ section in backend site Uncheck ‘Notify Requester’ checkbox in the list item with Title ‘Notification on Ticket Completion’ 2. Configure Workflow Manager to send mail with Survey link to Requester on Ticket Close Open ‘Crow Canyon Workflow Manager’ app from Application Administration under Crow Canyon NITRO Apps Configure Workflow with Send Mail action as shown below Send Mail action Mail Template configuration To configure ‘Survey Link’ hyperlink, click on ‘Insert/Edit’ link and configure as shown Example of URL – https://abc.sharepoint.com/sites/appl/itpro/Portal/SitePages/NewForm.aspx?lfid=4&FormKey=Service Satisfaction Survey&Related_x0020_Ticket_x0020_ID=[[ID || ID]] To copy portal ‘Survey Form’ URL, Open ‘Portal Settings’ –> Portal Forms–> Edit Service Satisfaction Survey list forms –> Form Settings and copy the Survey form URL as shown below When a Ticket gets closed then Ticket Requester will receive a mail with Survey link.

This is a two step process: Incoming emails first come to the ‘Email Tickets’ list: In SharePoint Online, this is configured using ‘Email Sync’ App. More details are in this article In SharePoint On-premises this is done using standard SharePoint functionality. Please refer first section in this article Crow Canyon application then converts this new Email item to a Ticket or links it to an existing Ticket In some cases, there is a need to have more than one incoming Email address for creating Tickets. For example, there may be a separate Email address for different Teams/Departments so that Tickets come to a different list and can have specific assignment or other process flow. This article describes the steps to configure Email to Ticket conversion feature for multiple Email addresses. Summary of steps Create Email Tickets lists with Email Tickets list template Configure Email to Ticket conversion feature SharePoint On-Premises SharePoint Online 1. Create Email Tickets list with Email Tickets list template 1. Take the template of “Email Tickets” list Go to Site Contents –> ‘Email Tickets’ list –> List Settings –> click on ‘Save list as template’ Give File name, Template name and click on “Ok”: After template is created, a success message will be displayed, click “Ok”.   2. Create a list with ‘Email Tickets’ list template. Goto Site Contents –> click on ‘Add an App’ –> click on ‘Email Tickets’ list –> give list name and click “Create”: You can give the required list name, in example below it is ‘Email Tickets 2’:   2. Configure Email to Ticket conversion feature SharePoint On-premises 1. After creating the new ‘Email Tickets 2’ list, check whether Workflow instance is attached or not. If yes, remove and add the workflow instance afresh. Go to ‘Email Tickets 2’ list –> List Settings –> Click ‘Workflow Settings’ –> click ‘Remove, Block or Restore a Workflow’ –> select “Remove” and click “OK”: 2. Now attach Workflow instance on ‘Email Tickets 2’ list. Go to ‘Email Tickets 2’ list –> List Settings –> Click ‘Workflow Settings’ –> click on “Add a workflow” –> Select “CCSSREmailCapture” workflow and give workflow instance name and click “Ok”: 3. Configure Incoming Email Address in newly created ‘Email Tickets 2’ list. Go to ‘Email Tickets 2’ list –> List settings –> Incoming Email Settings (in communications) –>specify required incoming Email address and click on “Ok”. The configured Email Address will be shown as below: Note: If you want to auto-set category for the Tickets created via email received on specific email address, then refer this article SharePoint Online 1. After creating the new Email Tickets list, configure Crow Canyon Email Sync service on this list. Please refer instructions from this article . Note In SharePoint online, we can have same ‘Email Tickets’ list for multiple incoming email addresses. There will be a separate configuration for each email address in Email Sync service that will refer to common ‘Email Tickets’ list. This can be done if we don’t want to have separate Email Tickets lists for each incoming email address. 2. Next, go to Application Administration -> General Configurations -> Switch to Email Handling tab and add newly created Email Tickets list name in new line in “Email Tickets Lists Names” column. 3. After adding the Email Tickets list, go to Crow Canyon NITRO Apps in Application Administration -> Open Crow Canyon Product App -> Deactivate the app feature and then activate again: Note To auto categorize Email Tickets based on either Sender/Email Tickets List, please refer additional configurations from https://www.crowcanyon.help/article/167/ "

These apps put the email content in a list and then Workflow Manager App is used to actually send the mail to the recipients. Same mechanism is also used by NITRO Applications like Crow Canyon Helpdesk solution. Below table gives details of the lists used by various NITRO apps for outgoing emails. For sending these emails, workflows are required to be configured on these lists and these are described in next section.   List Name Details Send Mails This list is used by NITRO Apps ‘Email Manager’ and ‘Custom Actions’. It is also used by some Crow Canyon applications like Service Request. It is required to configure the workflows on this list for outgoing emails functionality. CrowCanyonAppsEmails This list is used by NITRO Apps ‘Print Manager’ and ‘NITRO Reports’. If you are using outgoing emails in these apps then it is required to configure the workflows described below. CCSOutgoingMails This is a deprecated list and only used by NITRO ‘Custom Action’ app in SharePoint on-premises. Please note that ‘Custom Actions’ app in SharePoint Online uses ‘Send Mails’ list. If you have ‘Send Mails’ list in your site then you can safely delete this list. Otherwise, you can configure the workflows described below.   Workflows NITRO Apps create an item in the lists described above whenever an email has to be sent. The workflows configured on these lists then send the actual mail. We will take the example of ‘Send Mails’ list below, same configurations are required for other lists as well. Workflow 1 (Item Created Event – Send Mail Action): Used for emails without attachments Workflow 2 (Item Updated Event – Send Mail Action): Used for emails with attachments Workflow 3 (Timer based): This workflow processes any missing emails due to transient connectivity issues Workflow 4 (Timer based Delete Action): To delete old items from the list (after mails have been sent) Workflow 1 and Workflow 2 will be generally configured as part of Crow Canyon Application installation. In case they are not configured then you can refer and create as per configurations given below. Workflow 3 and Workflow 4 may not be configured by default. Create ‘Processed’ column in ‘Send Mails’ list Please create this column as per below details if it doesn’t exist already in the list. Column Name: Processed Workflow Configurations Go to Application Administration–> Crow Canyon Nitro Apps–> Crow Canyon Workflow Manager and create workflows as described below. Workflow 1: Send Mails/Item Created Create “Send Mail” Action :   Configure Mail Template as shown below: Create Update Item action :   Workflow 2: Send Mails/Item Updated workflow   Create Send Mail Action : Same as Workflow1 send mail action. Create Update Item action : Same as Workflow1 Item Update action   Workflow 3: Create a Timer based Workflow Some times email item gets created in the list but above workflows not getting triggered due to transient connectivity or server load issues. This workflow periodically checks for such missing emails. Create Send Mail action : Same as Workflow1 send mail action. Create Update Item action : Same as Workflow1 Item Update action Workflow 4: Workflow to delete old items from send mails list Please fefer: https://www.crowcanyon.help/article/223   "

    "text": " Basic permissions configurations in Crow Canyon Service Request Application Basic permissions configurations in Crow Canyon Service Request Application 2927 views 2 min , 42 sec read 4 Permission configurations in Crow Canyon Service Request application Applies to: SharePoint On-premises and Online Description: Crow Canyon Service Request application has two areas for configuration. There is the “backend” where staff and administrators will configure the program and work on their Tickets, requests, or work orders. Then there is the portal, where users can submit Tickets, requests, or work orders. We often refer to this as the “front end” of the application. Crow Canyon Service Request application has 4 different roles (SharePoint Groups) for accessing the two areas. End Users Staff Managers Administrators 1. End Users: This group of users are allowed to create Tickets and they can view their own Tickets form the portal. People who are members to only this group are not allowed to access the backend of the program. 2. Staff: This group of users can access the backend of the program. These people generally work from the “Staff Workspace” which shows Tickets that are assigned to them and the Tickets that are not yet assigned to anyone. These people are allowed to see all other Tickets using other quick launch links and can view reports etc. 3. Managers: This group of users can access the backend of the program. These people generally work from the “Manager Dashboard” which shows Tickets that are overdue and Tickets that are not yet assigned to anyone. Also, this workspace has more reports that helps the manager to understand the state of the Ticketing system. This group of people generally has the Full Control permission on the site so they are allowed to perform most of the operations. 4. Administrators: This group of users are the ones who can configure the system. They can be defined in an Administrators SharePoint group with Full Control permissions, or they can be defined as Site Collection Administrators. These people can use “Application Administration” to configure the application and can grant permissions to others as needed. Permission Levels and Group Associations: End Users – Contribute without delete (custom permission level, more detailed are described below) Staff – Contribute Managers – Full Control Administrators – Site Collection Administrators We can apply the permissions to corresponding groups as listed above on root site and inherit permissions in service area site (sub site). Note: Do not use the site visitors group for end users. Create a new SharePoint group for end users and add “Everyone Except External” users security group to this group. For more details, refer this Article These are simple/basic configurations, more granular permissions can be configured as needed. Summary of Steps: 1. Create SharePoint group for each role. Please note that we can use default site groups (“Visitors” for End Users, “Members” for Staff and Managers, and “Owners” for Administrators) for different roles instead of creating new groups. 2. Create a custom permission level (Contribute without delete). 3. Configure permissions on root site as described above in permission levels and group associations. 4. Inherit permissions in service area site (sub site). By default sub site inherits permissions from root site so this step can be ignored if the sub site permissions are not changed. 5. Add desired users to corresponding groups. 6. Configure redirection in Portal security settings. Detailed Steps: 1. Create a SharePoint group for each role with read permissions on root site in the site collection. If we decide to use the existing site groups then we can skip those groups creation. Go to site settings of root site of the site collection –> Site Permissions –> Create Group –> grant “Read” permissions. 2. Create custom permission level (Contribute without delete). Go to Site Settings–> go to top level settings –> Site Permissions –> Permission levels Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE MicrosoftInternetExplorer4 – Click on “Contribute” permissions Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE MicrosoftInternetExplorer4 – Now click on “Copy Permissions Level” in Contribute permissions. Using this template, create a new permission level “Contribute without delete” by unchecking all the “delete” permission levels in it. 3. Configure permissions on root site as described above in permission levels and group associations. Go to root site, Site Settings, Site Permissions and grant the permissions as described in permission levels and group associations above. (Sample screenshot below) – Grant “Contribute without Delete” permissions. This will allow users to create and manage Tickets without able to delete them. 4. Inherit permissions in service area site (sub site). By default sub site inherits permissions from root site so this step can be ignored if the sub site permissions are not changed. 5. Add d"

Creation of new Problems/CRs through email: When an email is sent to the configured e-mail address, a new Problem/CR should be created. b. Link emails to existing Problems/CRs: If the incoming emails contains CaseId syntax (e.g: [CaseId: 123]), it should link the email to existing Problem/CR. c. If the mail subject of an incoming email related to an existing Problem/CR contains $Resolved keyword, the Problem/CR should be resolved automatically. Pre- requisites: 1.  Create \"Email Problems\" and \"Email Change Requests\" lists (using Announcements list template). 2.  Configure Incoming Email address for these lists. 3.  Create \"RelatedProblemID\" and \"RelateChangeRequestID\" lookup fields these Emails lists pointing to ID column of Problems and Change Requests lists in \"Email Problems\" and \"Email Change Requests\" lists respectively. 4.  Create \"EmailID\" lookup field in Problem and CR lists pointing to \"Email Problems\" and \"Email Change Requests\" lists respectively. Summary of Steps: 1. Setup \"Email Problems\" and \"Email Change Requests\" lists as described in Pre-requisites. 2. Configure a workflow on Email Problems list item created event to create an item in Problems list whenever an item gets created in Emails list and update value of RelatedProblemID in the Emails item. 3. In the same workflow, create a WF Varaible action with $regextract function to check if there is a valid ticket CaseId in the mail subject. If it contains a valid CaseId, instead of creating a item, just update RelatedProblemID value. 4. Create another workflow to check if the mail subject of an incoming email related to an existing Problem/CR contains $Resolved keyword and update Request Status of the corresponding Problem/CR as Resolved. Detailed Steps: Go to Crow Canyon Workflow Manager and create workflows like below: Workflow1: This workflow will create an item in Problems list whenever Emails list receives an email and also updates the RelatedProblemID in Emails list. It will link this email to the existing Problem/CR if the incoming emails contains CaseId syntax Configure a workflow on Email Problems list like shown in below image when an item is created Cofigure below actions: Create Item action: This action will create an item in Problems list. 2. Query list action: This action will get the Related Problem item from Problems list. Query: <Where> <Eq> <FieldRef Name=’EmailID’ /> <Value Type=’Text’>##ID##</Value> </Eq> </Where> 3. Update Action: This action will update the Related Problem Id in Email Problems list. 4. WF Variable Action: If the incoming email contains CaseId then this action will extract the Related Problem ID from CaseId. Regex for CaseId: $regextract([Title|Title],@.*\\[CaseId: (.+)\\].*) 5. Query list Action: This action will get the Related Problem with CaseId from Problems list 6. Update Action: This action will link to the Related Problem/CR Workflow2: If the mail subject of an incoming email related to an existing Problem/CR and contains $Resolved keyword then this workflow will Resolve the Related Problem/CR automatically.

But if plain text is entered and in the column and save button in the ticket ribbon is used, this issue exists. Cause: A third party control is being used in the Discussion field. The user need to click somewhere on the form before clicking the save button (in the ribbon) in order to get the text saved in this control (in I.E). Resolution/Work around: Enforce the users to use save button at the bottom of the forms. Hide the “Save” button in ribbon which has this issue using a script like below. Go to Tickets list of the service area –> open Default Edit Form –> Add a Content Editor webpart to the Edit form.

An app link like ‘ https://companyname.sharepoint.com/sites/nitro/_layouts/15/appredirect.aspx ? instance_id={25EBAB29-FF45-4E84-764F-A9C9E14252464} ‘ will be copied. Step 5: Now append “&redirect_uri=[[Your Sub-Site URL]]&webId=[[Your Sub-Site Id]]” at the end of the link copied in the above step. The result link will be like ‘ https://companyname.sharepoint.com/sites/nitro/_layouts/15/appredirect.aspx ? instance_id= {25EBAB29-FF45-4E84-764F-A9C9E14252464} &redirect_uri=https://companyname.sharepoint.com/sites/nitro/itpremium& webId= d205fdef-840a-4c11-919e-469114e84265′ To get your subsite id use rest api call “[[Sub-Site Url]]+/_api/web/id” from your browser . Eg: ‘https://companyname.sharepoint.com/sites/nitro/itpremium/_api/web/id’. you will get your Sub-Site Id(web id) in the browser Repeat above steps for “Email Sync, Nitro Workflows, Advanced Approval” apps and construct URLs. Download ‘CCSProviderHosted.txt’ file from CCSProviderHosted , edit the file and replace the text “##NitroWorkflowsLink##”, “##EmailSyncLink##”, “##AdvancedApprovalsLink##’ with the respective App links that were constructed in the above steps. Upload ‘CCSProviderHosted.txt’ file to CrowCanyon folder of Site Assets library in sub-site after updating the links as mentioned in the above step. Now go to your subsite and open ‘Tiles’ list and switch to ‘All Promoted Links’ view of the list. Find the items with title ‘Crow Canyon Workflow Manager App’, ‘Crow Canyon Approval Workflow App’, ‘Crow Canyon Email Sync App’ and delete them. Now go to Application Administration, navigate to ‘Crow Canyon NITRO Apps’ or ‘Crow Canyon Apps’ page, edit the page and add a content editor web part to ‘Middle Column’ zone. Edit the content editor web part, in the Content Link section give the link of the file (CCSProviderHosted.txt) that was added to the ‘Crow Canyon’ folder in Site Assets library.

On every item creation, event will be fired and another Crow Canyon app \"Crow Canyon Product App\" captures that event and creates a ticket for that incoming email. Sometimes it is possible that event fire might be missed so ticket creation may miss. To handle such situations, our Crow Canyon Product Maintenance service will periodically check and create them as tickets. Few things to consider: 1. We have \"Incoming Email Processing\" utility and it is possible to configure such that cerrtain email with subject/body contains certain keywords can be skipped from ticket creation. 2. There is another possible reason that the ticket created might got deleted by someone. The deleted tickets might be present in the Recycle bin. The ticket can be restored from there to populate in the Tickets list. If both the above things are not applicable, then our Product maintenance service supposed to initiate the ticket for such missing emails. If the ticket is still not created for missing emails, it could be Email Tickets list crosses the list view threshold limit of 5000 items and it cannot be increased in SharePoint Online, to address this, certain columns need to be indexed in Email Ticket list so our Product Maintenance App can process the missing emails.

    "text": " Email / Frequently asked questions for Crow Canyon Email Sync App Frequently asked questions for Crow Canyon Email Sync App 5373 views 3 min , 42 sec read 3 Applies To SharePoint Online Crow Canyon Email Sync App Overview Crow Canyon Email sync app is an add-in for O365. SharePoint online doesn’t have built-in functionality similar to Announcements Lists in on-premises where emails sent to a particular address are automatically added to the list in SharePoint. This App plugs this functionality gap by monitoring a mailbox that is accessible via Exchange Web Services and creates the mails received as items in a SharePoint list. This App can be used as a stand-alone product. It is used in Crow Canyon Applications like IT Help Desk for incoming emails to Ticket functionality. When an email is sent to an email address configured in Crow Canyon Email Sync app then these emails get created as Incoming emails in Email Tickets list. Further, Crow Canyon Product App converts these Email Items to Tickets along with other functionality like notifications and auto-assignment etc. To know more about the Email Sync App, please refer: https://www.crowcanyon.info/nitro/appmanual_v2/email-sync.html To know more about configurations of this app, please refer link: https://www.crowcanyon.info/nitro/appmanual_v2/configuring-email-sync.html 1. What is Exchange Web Service URL in Crow Canyon Email Sync app? Exchange Web Service provides the functionality to enable client applications to communicate with the Exchange Server. It provides access to mailbox data stored in Exchange Online. If you are using Exchange Online (O365) then you can specify the standard Microsoft Web Services URL: https://outlook.office365.com/EWS/Exchange.asmx If you are using in-house or hosted Exchange then please get the web services URL from the concerned team. Please note that this is not same as the Outlook Web Access (OWA) URL . Note : If any settings are modified in Crow Canyon Email Sync settings changes take effect after about 15 minutes. 2. Multi-Factor Authentication is enabled for the users If Multi-Factor Authentication is enabled for the email address which is configured in Crow Canyon Email Sync settings then it does not allow office client application to access SharePoint with regular password. Please refer this article to create an app password. After creating app password, use this email address and password in Crow Canyon Email Sync settings. Note : App password does not work for auto discovery so we need to enter the Exchange Web Service URL manually. Please refer #1 above for more details on Exchange Web Service URL. 3. Can we directly configure Crow Canyon Email sync settings to Tickets? No, Email Items should not be created directly in the Tickets list. For Crow Canyon Applications there is a special App that converts the incoming email items to Tickets along with other business logic like auto-assignment, status handling, Categorization and notifications etc. So Email Sync App should be configured to create items in ‘Email Tickets’ list only. Please note that you can configure multiple incoming email lists and also rename them. Refer this article for more details: https://www.crowcanyon.help/article/167 4. Emails coming to mailbox configured in the Email Sync Setting are not reaching Email Tickets list – This issue occurs if there is a password change for the mailbox that is used in our Email Sync setting, please update the Email Sync Setting with the latest password and specify the Exchange Web Service URL as mentioned in #1 of this article Note: Usually, it takes around 15 minutes for the new settings/changes in email sync settings to take effect. – Sync service creates an item in the Email Tickets list for every new email that comes to the mailbox configured in the Email Sync Setting. The email sync setting has a filter that can be configured which might be blocking creation of items. For example, we might block certain emails to convert as an Email Ticket if subject contains “Test” or “Out of Office” emails. See sample filter screenshot below. Please check the mails that didn’t reach Email Tickets list if verify if they match the conditions specified in the filter settings. 5. Connection Error while trying to configure mailbox settings in Email Sync configuration Crow Canyon Email Sync configuration page has a ‘Test Connection’ button. This can be clicked after specifying the mailbox address and password. If connection is successful, it will automatically fill the Exchange Web Service URL. Generally if you are using O365 Web Exchange, it will be: https://outlook.office365.com/EWS/Exchange.asmx Symptom 1: Test connection will fail with connection error “A valid SMTP address must be specified” as shown below: Please check with your Exchange Administrator for the Exchange Web Service URL in case you are not using O365 exchange. Specify the internal Exchange web services URL (not OWA URL) and click on test connection. Also, please m"

How to customize SharePoint list view filter conditions using SharePoint Designer? 11223 views 1 min , 3 sec read 2 Design view filter using SharePoint Designer Applies to: SharePoint Online and On-Premises Description: It is difficult to configure grouping (Multiple AND & OR) in SharePoint list view filter conditions using SharePoint view settings UI. Also, SharePoint supports maximum of 10 columns to filter in the view. In order to overcome this limitation, the view filter query (CAML Query) can be modified using the SharePoint Designer as per the requirement. In this example, we are replacing the CAML query such that “Tasks” list view shows the items where “Assigned To” is either logged in user or the groups where the logged in user is a member. Detailed Steps: – Run SharePoint designer as Administrator, Open the site. Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE – Provide Site URL in the “Site Name” text box (highlighted area in below screenshot) and open – Click Lists and Libraries in the navigation pane Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE – Click on the desired list under “Lists” and it will pull all the list information Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE – Click on the desired view from available views.

Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE – Open Source view mode by selecting Code as shown below Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE – Now Add/replace existing Where clause in CAML Query part of the view with the desired CAML query.

By default, there are four values for this status: -Not Started Ticket is created but not assigned to any technician/assigned staff In Progress When the ticket is assigned a technician/assigned staff, product workflow updates the status with “In Progress” value automatically. If the assigned staff is emptied when the status is “In Progress”, product workflow sets the status back to “Not Started” Notifications work as per the “Notification on Ticket Assignment” utility Resolved Assigned Staff/technician to set the status to “Resolved” manually and notifications work as per the “Notification on Ticket Resolve” utility. Closed Assigned Staff/technician to set the ticket status to “Closed” manually and notifications work as per the “Notification on Ticket Close” utility. Number of days to auto close the resolved tickets can be configured from “Application Administration, General Configurations, edit the Status Handing tab, and set the “Number of days to auto close resolved tickets” column value to desired number of days. Crow Canyon Application uses these status values and these can’t be changed as otherwise application state machine may not work correctly. Additional Request status values can be added to the “Request Status” field and these can be used as needed (For example, differed). If we would like to send notifications or perform some action when the ticket status changes to the newly added option, we can use Crow Canyon Workflow Manager solution.

How to configure external email address as “From Address” in the Notifications Utilities? 4779 views 1 min , 15 sec read 0 Applies to: SharePoint On-Premises and SharePoint Online Description: Crow Canyon service request application standard auto notifications takes the from address from standard notifications utilities and will send mails to recipients. As part of the standard installation configurations, from address in different environments are configured as described below: On-premises: The notifications utilities takes the “from address” from the SharePoint Central Administration, Outgoing Email settings if the “From Address” columns left blank in notification utilities. Online: “From Address” is mandatory to configure in Notification utilities. In general it is “noreply@sharepointonline.com” There is a feature “Email To Ticket conversion and Email Capture” in both environments. For enabling this feature, in On-Premises environment, incoming email settings need to be configured for the “Email Tickets” list and for online version, Email Sync app setting need to be configured for the desired mailbox. If we use this incoming email address as from address for outgoing notifications then whenever the user reply back to the auto notification and/or technician mail, it goes back to SharePoint application and will be captured as part of the “Email History”. To achieve this, we will need to configure “From Address” as incoming email address which may not have the associated user account. By design “From Address” column is a person or group field so it could resolve only valid user account. To configure custom from address recreate the “From Address” as “Single line of Text” field in all notification utilities. Steps to recreate the “From Address” Field: Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE – Delete the “From Address” field and recreate a new single line of text column with the field name as “FromAddress”, (please make sure that there is no space between two words). Later the display name can be set as “From Address”. The above step needs to be done in all the notification utility lists mentioned below: – Notification on Ticket Creation (Online and On-Premises) – Notification on Ticket Assignment (Online and On-Premises) – Notification on Ticket completion (Online and On-Premises) – Notification on Incoming Email (Online and On-Premises) – Notification on Ticket Resolution (On-Premises only) – Notification on Ticket Reactivation (On-Premises only) – Auto Status Utility (On-Premises only) – SLA Definition (On-Premises only) Edit all the above utility items, enter the desired from address and save.

For sample scenario we have taken CCSSRWorkflows.wsp solution. Instructions: Go to Central Administration –> System Settings –> Manage Farm solutions –> Open “CCSSRWorkflows.wsp” and retract the solution. Wait until the solution status changes to “Not Deployed” and then open the solution again and remove the solution. Troubleshooting steps if above process doesn’t work: If the solution got stuck at Retracting, we can run the command to execute pending jobs that will perform all the pending jobs in the server using the steps given below: 1. Stop the SharePoint timer and administration services in SharePoint server. Go to Start –> Type Services.msc –> Right click on it and Run it as Administrator –> stop the “Sharepoint Administration” service and “Sharepoint Timer” services. 2. Run Command Prompt as Administrator and set the path to “C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\Web Server Extensions\\16\\Bin” . 3. Run command as “STSADM.EXE -o execadmsvcjobs” . 4. Start SharePoint administration and Timer services. Note: 1 . In case of Multiple Servers, repeat these steps in all of the SharePoint servers that have the “Microsoft SharePoint Foundation Web Application” Service running in it. To know the service running in the Server, please go to SharePoint Central Administration –> System Settings –> Manage Servers in the Farm. Here we can see the services running under each Server. 2. If we are removing the Crow Canyon Forms Manager solution, we need to remove the safe control instance from web.config file from path: C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\wss\\VirtualDirectories\\WebApplication Port Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE MicrosoftInternetExplorer4 Take the backup of Web.config file, edit the web.config file and remove the below line and save the file. “<SafeControl Assembly=”CrowCanyon.FormsManager, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=6712f91b73fef060″ Namespace=”CrowCanyon.FormsManager.ListManagerElements” TypeName=”*” Safe=”True” />” Screenshot: Note: If we do not find the “SafeControl” entry in web.config file, it is possible that the default location of virtual directory could be changed. Open IIS, expand Sites, right click on the web application name, and click “Explore”. This will open the correct virtual directory location so we can remove the Forms Manager’s SafeControl entry. "

Case 1: Email comes to Email Tickets list but Ticket is not created in tickets list If the item is created in Email Tickets list for an email but Ticket doesn’t gets created in Tickets list then check whether the Email Capture workflow instance is in allowed state or not in Email Tickets list. Go To Email Tickets list –> List Settings –> Workflow Settings –> click on ‘Remove, Block or Restore a Workflow’ and check if the workflow instance is set to ‘Allow’. If not, then set it to ‘Allow’ and click Ok. Please note that workflow will not run automatically for existing items, you can run it manually as described further: If the Email Capture workflow instance is in allowed state, verify if the workflow instance was invoked for the email ticket item for which Ticket is not created. To verify this, click “Workflows” from the edit control block of the email ticket item and see if there is an instance already present (refer image below) If the workflow instance is invoked, click on the workflow instance “Completed” link and send us the screenshot to troubleshoot further Workflows link in Edit Control of the email tickets list item: Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE MicrosoftInternetExplorer4 Workflow Instance page: If workflow is invoked and still ticket is not created, requested logs will help us investigating this issue (refer ‘Further Steps’ below) If workflow is not invoked, then run workflow instance manually as per instructions given below Instructions to run Email Capture workflow instance manually: Go to Email Tickets –> List Settings –> Workflow Settings –> Edit Email Capture Workflow –> Enable “Allow this workflow to be manually started by an authenticated User”. Once the workflow instance is allowed to run manually, select the Email Ticket and click on Workflows from ECB and click Email Capture to run workflow. Further steps: Verify if there are any configurations in Email Handling Utility that could stop processing Email Tickets (Spam tickets elimination if subject/body contains certain keywords, Exclude Cc/Bcc etc). Go to Application Administration –> Email Configurations –> Incoming Email Processing –> Email Handling Utility. Please refer this article for more details regarding Email Handling Utiltiy: http://www.crowcanyon.info/sharepoint-manuals-37/email_configurations.html Please enable logs for Crow Canyon Product Workflows and reproduce the issue and send us the “CCSSRECLog.txt” file. Please refer instructions to enable logs for Crow Canyon product Workflows from: https://www.crowcanyon.help/article/229 Case 2: Duplicate tickets are being created in Tickets list for the incoming emails 1. Possible reason could be if you have mutliple SharePoint servers in the farm. If Incoming email and SMTP service are enabled in every server, it leads to duplicate mails in the Email Tickets list and then these are converted to Tickets. To avoid this, have Incoming Email and SMTP service enabled on only one server and disable for all other servers 2. If the incoming email does not contains Case ID in the email subject then new ticket would be created for those incoming email. Please refer this http://crowcanyon.info/absolutefm/afmviewfaq.aspx?faqid=306 article to configure CaseId in the workflow manager mail templates. 3. If auto reply (Out of office) rules are configured in the mailbox settings then those auto replies comes back to our SharePoint list (Email Tickets list) if the user has configured from address as Email Tickets list address. To avoid this, we can configure “Out of Office” in the subject line in “Email Handling Utility” so that it exclude such type of emails from ticket creation. Please refer this article http://www.crowcanyon.info/sharepoint-manuals-37/email_configurations.html for more details regarding Email Handling Utility Case 3: Attachments missing in Tickets Issue: Attachments are present in Email Ticket but those attachements are not being added to the ticket while converting them as tickets Cause: This issue could happen due to the save conflicts while adding attachments to tickets. To confirm this, verify if there are any save conflict errors present in the Email Capture log file (File name: CCSSRECLog.txt) from path “C:\\CCSSRLogFiles” folder. If there are no errors or if logs are not generated, enable the logs for Crow Canyon Product Workflows"

Images used are from Workflow Manager On-prem solution, but can be used for online app as well with very similar steps. In this case we are taking the example of status value change for an item in Tickets list. When a Ticket item is ‘assigned’ to a staff, we want to notify the requester, assigned staff and additional contact users specified on the Ticket. Also, we want to send a mail to a fixed user (not in one of the fields in the Ticket item). Crow Canyon product has a standard feature for this functionality. However, for custom requirements like sending portal based Ticket link to staff users, this kind of workflow can be configured and standard functionality disabled. Please refer below link for standard functionality: Notification on New Ticket Creation: http://www.crowcanyon.info/sharepoint-manuals-37/notification_on_new.html Summary of Workflow Configuration Configure a workflow on item modified event with conditions to check for the required status value as the value after item update Configure a mail template with required information and links Configure a send mail action using the template from step 2 Workflow Configuration 1.

Detailed steps Disable Notify Assigned Staff on Incoming Email: When Requester sends an email to the existing ticket, staff will receive notification and “Work Log” of the ticket will be updated with truncated mail body. In this article we will send notification to Assigned Staff when the “Work Log” is modified using Crow Canyon Workflow Manager so we can disable the “Notify Staff” on Incoming Email. To disable this feature, go to Site Contents –> ‘Notification on Incoming Email’ list -> Edit the item and disable “Notify Staff” (see screenshot below) Notify Requester/Assigned Staff on Work log update: We can notify Ticket Requester when there is an update to the ticket Work Log by technician and vice versa. We can configure a workflow using Crow Canyon Workflow Manager for this.

Please note that Archive related lists should not have any workflow instances or event receivers attached to them. After creating the lists as described in this article, refer #2 and #3 from this article: https://www.crowcanyon.help/article/277 1. Take list templates for Tickets, Email Tickets, Associated Tasks, Calendar and Time Tracking lists Go to Site Contents –>Tickets list –>List Settings –>Click on ‘Save list as Template’ link: — Give File name,Template Name and click on “Ok” Similarly, take list templates for other lists. 2. Create Archive Lists — Create archival lists (Archived Tickets, Archived Email Tickets, Archived Associated Tasks, Archived Calendar, Archived Time Tracking lists) using these list templates created in step 1 (The idea behind creating Archived Email Tickets, Arichived Time Tracking, Archived Calendar and Archived Associated Tasks lists is to move email history and related tasks along with tickets during the archival process). — Creating Archived tickets list: Go to Site Contents –> Add an App –> Select Tickets list Template –> name it as Archived Tickets list — Similarly create Archived Email Tickets, Archived Time Tracking,Archived Calendar and Archived Associated Tasks lists using their correspoinding list templates 3. Verify Lookup and Associated Items Fields Once archive lists are created, we need to verify the lookup fields. Also, some lookup fields have to be recreated so that they refer archive lists instead of the original lists. — For some lookup fields like Category and Issue Type, they will continue to refer the same lists as the original Tickets list. We need to navigate to the field settings of these lookups and just verify that they are having the correct settings — For other lookups, such as ‘Related Ticket Id’ in Email Tickets list, we need to recreate this lookup so that it refers to Archive Tickets list instead of the original Tickets list. Correspondingly, we need to recreate the Associated Items fields that are referring these recreated lookup fields. Please refer the details given below to verify and recreate these fields Fields in Archived Email Tickets list: Internal name: RelatedTicketID Display name: Related Ticket ID Fields in Archived Time Tracking list: I nternal name: TicketID Display name: Related Ticket ID Fields in Archived Assoicated Tasks list: Internal name: RelatedTicketID Display name: Related Ticket ID Fields in Archived Calendar list: 4. Reconfigure Associated Items columns — Delete all ‘Crow Canyon Associated Items’ columns from Archived Tickets list and re-create using the newly created lookup fields so that they they show items from corresponding archive lists Delete Time Tracking, Email History, Appointments, and Associated Tasks fields from Archived Ticekts list. — Create below fields in Archived Tickets list Go to Site Contents –> Archived Tickets list –> List Settings –> Create associated columns like shown below. Internal Name : TimeTracking Display name: Time Tracking Internal Name: IT Associated Task Display Name: IT Associated Task Internal Name: Email History Display Name: Email History Internal Name: Appointments Display Name: Appointments After creating the list schema, please configure Archival settings with newly created list like shown below Please refer this article http://www.crowcanyon.info/sharepoint-manuals-37/archiving_tickets.html for more details regarding Archival functionality.

How to troubleshoot Report Center issues? 2604 views 2 min , 22 sec read 1 Troubleshooting steps for Report Center issue Applies to: SharePoint 2013, 2016 I) Symptom: After configuring the report, when we click “Create Report” button, it shows list doesn’t exist error and and report is not created. “The page you selected might contains a list that doesn’t exist. It may have been deleted by another user” (see screenshot for sample error) Cause: Report is not configured with target library Resolution: This issue can happen if Report Center document library is not configured in Report Center page. To fix this please go to “Report Center” page from top link bar, New Report–> Edit the page–> Edit the New Report web part and select the Report Center document library as shown like below. Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE Screenshot:   Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE II) Symptom: Error when creating the chart using flash chart rendering engine. (Note: Flash chart rendering engine is required for charts only and not required for tables) Cause: Adobe flash player 6 is not installed. Resolution: Please download and install adobe flash player 6 or above and try again. Alternatively you can use HTML5 reports that doesn’t depend on Flash and provide better functionality Screenshot:   Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE III) Symptom: After configuring the report, when we click “Create Report” button, the report will be generated but when you open the report, it doesn’t get loaded (keeps showing loading…) Cause: Could be due to List view/Lookup view threshold exceeded Resolution: If the selected list has more than the lookup threshold or list view threshold, please fix it in central admin as shown below. Go to central administration –> application management –> manage web applications –> click on the web application you working on –> click on general settings in web applications ribbon –> click on Resource Throttling and increase the lookup count as shown below. Alternatively, you can remove unnecessary lookup/person and group columns from the list. For list view threshold, you can modify the view filters to return less than the threshold items   Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE Screenshot:   Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE IV) Symptom: A blank page appears in report center page and edit report page. (See screenshot). Cause: The selected list may have one or more duplicate columns. Generally SharePoint does not allow creating duplicate columns, however, sometime if we add a content type then it is possible to get duplicate columns with same name. For example, I have a list with Priority column and later I have added the Task Content type to this list and removed the content type again, in this case it is possible that the list ends up with two priority columns. This issue occur very rarely as it involves two content types with both having field with same name. Please check the list settings page and ensure that the list does not have any duplicate columns. Resolution: If the selected list has duplicate columns, please remove the column(s) that are not in use. Or rename one of the duplicate columns Screenshot:   V) Symptom: “ Manage Templates” or “New Report” links in Report Center page is redirect to wrong URL. Cause: Report links web part is not configured in Report Center page Resolution: We need to configure the report links web part in all the pages that are present in the Report Center document library. Detailed Instructions: Please go to Site Contents –> Report Center document library–> Copy the URLs of “Report and Manage Templates” pages and separate them with semicolon (;) and copy the new URL. Ex: http://focusonsharepoint.biz/demo/itpremium/IT/Report%20Center/Reports.aspx;http://focusonsharepoint.biz/demo/itpremium/IT/Report%20Center/Manage%20Templates.aspx Next go to Report Center document library –> Open “CCSReportsPageBaseTemplate” page –> Edit the page –> Edit Report Links web part –> Update the URL in “New Report Page URL” text box with the copied URL (see screenshot below). Repeat the above step for all the pages that are present in the Report Center document library. VI) Symptom: Access Denied error appears for the users when trying to access “Report Center” pages even though they have edit permissions on the site. Cause: This happens if the user is not having at least read permissions on the root site. Resolution: Grant read permissions on the root site for the users that need report center access.

Similarly, attachments are added to new item and added/removed from existing item using the APIs. For each attachment a separate operation has to be performed and with standard API, this increments the version of the item. This implies that if an item is created with 4 attachments, it will have 5 versions after the save. One version will be for normal save of the item and one version each for the attachments added to the item. Any downstream products like Workflows that are triggered on item update, will be triggered 5 times in quick succession and this can result in some issues like ‘save conflicts’ or inability to detect change in the item field values that workflows depend on. This issue is handled in Crow Canyon Product in following ways: Forms code doesn’t use standard API to add/remove attachments from the item. Instead it directly works with folders to avoid creating versions and doesn’t fire the item update event while handling attachments Because of above, SharePoint standard forms and views don’t show the item attachments. So additional code is added in these forms to update the item properties to show the attachments If you notice any issue in attachment handling then please refer below cases to idenfiy and configure the solutions to fix the issue. SharePoint Online based Products: 1) Item Attachments not showing in Default SharePoint Forms (classic view) when attachments are added using Portal or NITRO Forms A.

Incoming Emails When user sends an email to the helpdesk email address which is configured in Email Tickets list, our product workflows will create an item in tickets list for those incoming emails. Email to Ticket conversion flow: User sends an email to the email address which is configured in Email Tickets list Exchange forwards the email to SharePoint SMTP service SMTP service puts the mail in drop folder on SharePoint server (check settings in IIS 6.0 Manager like configure domains etc.) If the mail is not reaching the Drop folder (C:\\intepub\\mailroot\\Drop), you can check further by enabling the SMTP Service logs. To enable the logs, please go to IIS 6.0 Manager –> Right click on SMTP Service –> Properties and enable the logging as shown below   After enabling the log, restart the SMTP Service (both in services.msc and in IIS 6.0 Manager), send a test email to “Email Tickets” address and check if logs are generated. If logs are not generated then most likely something is not configured correctly and exchange is not even invoking this service to deliver the email. If log is generated then check if there are any errors and also see if the email is reaching the SharePoint Server (Drop Folder) SharePoint Timer service picks the item from drop folder and creates the item in Email Tickets list (based on address configured in list). Please ensure that this service is running (services.msc) Refer articles like these if mail is coming to Drop folder but not coming to the configured list: https://sharepoint.stackexchange.com/questions/13253/incoming-mail-just-sits-in-the-drop-folder   After this, Crow Canyon workflows picks up new items from Email Tickets list and creates the Ticket. Please note that Crow Canyon application comes into picture only after the SharePoint infrastructure has delivered the mail to the configured list (Announcement Type list having the configured email address).   Pre-requisites for Email to Ticket conversion: SMTP service should be running in the SharePoint server (Services.msc). Microsoft SharePoint Foundation incmonig E-mail service should be running in the SharePoint server where the SMTP service is installed (Central Administartion–>Manage servers in this farm) Note: Microsoft SharePoint Foundation incoming E-mail service is cannot be provisioned in “Web Front-end” role, it should be either in application server role or custom role. Please refer more details from: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt667910(v=office.16).aspx Incoming email settings should be configured in Central Administration. To configure, please go to Central Administration –> System Settings –> Configuring incoming e-mail settings. For more details about Incoming Email Settings refer this article https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc262947.aspx Incoming Email settings should be enabled in Email Tickets list in Crow Canyon helpdesk application. For more details regarding Incoming Email settings configuration in Crow Canyon helpdesk application, please refer Email Settings from http://www.crowcanyon.info/sharepoint-manuals-37/index.html If we would like to use an already existing mailbox like support@company.com, then required forward rules needs to be configured in Exchange so if any email arrives to support@company.com will be forwarded to “email@FQDN of server” Note: Our Product workflows will process the emails once the email is arrived to “Email Ticket” list. If the email item is not created in Email Tickets list please note that it is outside the scope of our application support. 2. Outgoing Emails In our application, outgoing emails will notify the requester or staff on every stage of ticket life cycle. Areas where mails go out from Crow Canyon application: 1. Auto Notifications (Ticket Creation, Assignment, Resolution, Completion, Reactivation etc) 2. Crow Canyon Advanced Email 3. Crow Canyon Workflow Manager Pre-requisites for out going emails: 1. Outgoing e-mail settings should be configured in Central Administration (go to Central Administration –> System Settings –>Configuring outgoing e-mail settings) For more details about Outgoing Email Settings refer this article https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc263462.aspx 2.Configure Crow Canyon Advanced Email settings in Tickets list, in order to send mails from helpdesk application.

Case 1: If auto notifications are not working 1. If users are not receiving any auto notifications on Ticket Creation, Assignment, Resolution, Completion and Reactivation then verify the users (Requester, Assigned Staff, Notify Staff, Assigned Team etc.) in Auto Notification utilities in Crow Canyon Application (go to Crow Canyon help desk site –>Application Administration –> Notifications–> Notification on Ticket Creation/Assignment/Resolution/Completion/Reactivation). Ex: If Assigned Staff not getting notification when a ticket gets assigned to him. We need to verify the settings in auto notifications i.e. Notification on Ticket Assignment. Go to Application Administration –> Notifications –> Notification on Ticket Assignment and verify the “Assigned Staff” notification setting is enabled or not (see screenshot below). 2. Verify the Workflow instances in Tickets list. (Go to Tickets list –> List Settings –> Workflow Settings –> click on Remove,Block or Restore a Workflow and check if the workflow instances are in allowed or not.) 3. Verify if the user account (who is not receiving the emails) is having the email address or not. To check the email address, open display form of any item which is having the user account (who are not receiving the emails) in any person or group column and click on the name of the person and verify the email address (see screenshots below). 4. Verify if the SMTP server port number is using the default port number (i.e. 25) or not in the SharePoint Central Administration. To verify the SMTP port number, go to SharePoint Central Administration –> System Settings –> Outgoing E-mail Settings and check the SMTP port number. If you are not using the default SMTP port number, please contact Crow Canyon support (Mail: crowcanyonsupport@crowcanyon.com ) to get the latest Crow Canyon solutions to support custom SMTP port number in Central Administration. Case 2: If emails are sent using Crow Canyon Advanced Email Verify the Crow Canyon Advanced Email settings configuration in Tickets list. Go to Tickets list –> List Settings –> Crow Canyon Advanced Email Settings –> Click on Advanced Email Options and refresh the Outbound SMTP server and click save. If you are using custom SMTP port number in Outgoing Emails configuration in Central Administration, please specify the Port number and click save. Case 3: Notification on Ticket creation is not delivered only for the tickets created from email. Please enable the diagnostic logs for the Crow Canyon Product Workflows referring to #1 from https://www.crowcanyon.help/article/229/ . If the log file contains an error regarding the SMTP Client authentication, make sure the Service account of the SharePoint Timer Service has permissions on Receiver Connector in the Exchange. When the ticket is created manually, application pool identity is being used to send outgoing emails. Whereas, the timer service account identity is being used for the tickets created via incoming emails. Probably timer service account does not have permissions on the “Receiver connector” in the Exchange. Please check with your Exchange Administrator and grant the desired permissions to timer service account on Exchange receiver connector and check the result again Sample Error message below: The SMTP server requires a secure connection or the client was not authenticated. The server response was: 5.7.1 Client was not authenticated Case 4: Notification on Ticket assignment is sent on Ticket creation even though Assigned Staff is not set for the Ticket Existing Behavior When a new Ticket is created with particular category and issue type, our auto assignment takes place. Category Owner, Assigned Team present in the selected category gets notified that there is a ticket assigned for them and “Assigned Team” value is set in the Ticket. “Assigned Staff” will be set if configured for the Issue Type selected in the Ticket and the Assigned Staff gets notified as well on Ticket assignment Cause In some cases, where Assigned Team/Category Owner is set for the category but “Assigned Staff” is empty for the issue type selected, notification on ticket assignment will be sent to the recipients but Assigned staff value is empty in the notification and the Ticket which may confuse the user/recipient.

You can also refer this article for frequently asked questions about the Portal: https://www.crowcanyon.help/article/197 Case 1: Item Creation Failed Applies to: SharePoint Online and On-premises (2013, 2016, 2019) Employee Portal Version:  Portal site created through ‘Power Portal App’ Issue:  Error shown while creating Ticket from Portal – “Field or Property does not exist”: Cause:  The cause of the issue is that number of lookup (lookups + person or group) columns in the tickets list exceeds the lookup threshold limit in Central Administration (fixed as 12 lookups in SP Online). Fix:  To avoid this, we can increase the lookup threshold limit in SharePoint Central Administration for the required web application for On-premises as described below. SharePoint Online: For SharePoint Online case or if you cannot increase the threshold then delete any unused lookup / person or group columns from the list. You can also convert lookups to NITRO Lookups fields to get around this threshold. See our manual for more information:  https://www.crowcanyon.info/nitro/appmanual_v2/lookup-settings.html SharePoint On-premises: To increase lookup threshold in, follow below steps: Go to SharePoint Central Administration –> Application Management –> Manage Web application –> Select the web application and click “Resource Throttling” from General Settings and increase the lookup threshold limit see screenshot below: Case 2: “Portal Settings” button is not visible for users who are members of ‘Site Owners’ group Applies to: SharePoint Online and On-premises (2013, 2016, 2019) Employee Portal Version: Portal site created through ‘Power Portal App’ Portal settings button is shown to users having manage-web permissions on portal site. Generally, ‘Site Owners’ group has this permission, and this button is visible for users who are members of this group. Issue:  “Portal Settings” button is not visible even though user has Manage Web Site permissions (via Site Owners group). Cause:  This is an environment specific issue, and it is not clear why permission check is not giving the correct result for logged-in user. Resolution: Configure new menu link for portal settings page with permissions to show only for owner’s group. This provides similar functionality as the standard portal settings button. Instructions Go to “Configure Portal Settings” page by navigating to below URL: URL: ##Portal Site URL##/SitePages/AddEditSettings.aspx Example: https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/Helpdesk/IT/Portal/SitePages/AddEditSettings.aspx Navigate to “Menu Section” tab under ‘Common UI Settings’ section and click “New Menu Item” as shown below: Configure new menu item link and save the settings. URL to be used is same as in step #1 above. Sample Output Case 3: User gets a prompt for credentials on clicking ‘Service Catalog’ link in the Portal Applies to : SharePoint On-premises (2013, 2016, 2019) Employee Portal Version : Portal site created through ‘Power Portal App’ Issue: User gets a prompt for credentials on clicking ‘Service Catalog’ link in the Portal. Cause: This issue can happen if user does not have ‘Browse Directories’ permission on root site of the site collection. Resolution: Grant ‘Browse Directories’ permission on root site of the site collection for end users group. Instructions Standard “Read” permission level does not contain this permission. So, we need to create a custom permission level and then grant this permission to end users group. Create a custom permission level. Grant newly created custom permission level to end users group. Detailed steps Navigate to root site of the site collection (in which portal site exists) -> Site Settings -> ‘Site permissions’ under ‘Users and Permissions’ section -> Permission Levels -> click ‘Read’ permission level -> click ‘Copy Permission Level’ and create a new permission level as shown below: Name the new permission level as ‘Read with Browse Directory’ and select the ‘Browse Directories’ permission. After creating the new permission level, assign it to end users group. In this example, we have assigned custom permission level to ‘End Users’ group. Go to ‘Site permissions’ page -> select the end users group and click ‘Edit User Permissions’ from the ribbon. Select the new permission level ‘Read with Browse Directory’ and save settings. "

Crow Canyon has several solutions that enhance the experience of SharePoint list forms. This issue could be in any of these products: 1. Default SharePoint forms (Case 2.2 below) 2. Crow Canyon Forms Manager for SP On-premises / Online 3. NITRO Forms, Portal or Enhanced List Forms for SPOnline 4. NITRO Forms and Portal for SP On-premises   Case 1: If the column is not added to the tabs/sections 1. Column needs to be added to the tabs/sections from the settings of the respective Forms solution. To add column into the tabs follow below steps: SharePoint On-premises: To add column to the tabs, go to the list –> List Settings –> Crow Canyon Tabs and Tab settings –> Edit any tab and add the column to the tab. SharePoint Online: Go to Application Administration –> Crow Canyon Nitro Apps –> Crow Canyon Forms Manager  –> Edit the tab and add the column into the tab. NITRO and Portal: Go to form settings and then add the column to tab/section (check NITRO Forms or Enhanced List Forms App as per what is used for the list)   Case 2: Column is added to the tabs but still not visible in the form 1. Verify if any column permissions are configured for that column. Depending on permission configurations and data in the item form, column could be hidden. To verify the column permissions follow the below steps: SharePoint On-premises: Go to the List –> List Settings –> Crow Canyon Column Permisison Settings and verify the column permissions SharePoint Online: Go to Application Administration –> Crow Canyon Nitro Apps –> Crow Canyon Forms Manager –> Column permisisons section–> select the column and check if there are any column permisisons are configured for the column. NITRO and Portal: Go to form settings and then check the column permissions (check NITRO Forms or Enhanced List Forms App as per what is used for the list)     2. Verify if the column is hidden from the Content type SharePoint Online and On-premises: Go to the SharePoint List –> List Settings –> Edit the Content Type and verify if the column is hidden from the content type or not (see screenshot below). If the column is hidden then make the column as ‘Optional’ . Note: If the ‘Content Types’ is not available in the list settings, click on Advanced Settings in the list settings and enable the \"Allow management of content types\"   3. Verify if column is present in multiple tabs/sections. In this case if any Tab has a permission that hides the tab, then columns configured for that tab will be hidden from the Form. To fix this, check the Tabs where column is added and then check the corresponding tab permissions. You may want to modify the tab permissions or remove the column from the tab that is getting hidden due to permissions. Refer Case 1 above to navigate to tab settings    "

This forces user to make the selection for the lookup column Applies To: SharePoint Online and SharePoint On-Premises (2013/2016/SharePoint Server Subscription Edition) Description When a lookup column is set as mandatory, it will be auto-selected with first value in the drop-down (column setting option: “Require that this column contains information”). This means user can save the Form without selecting the value for lookup column since it is already populated with a value. In many cases it is desired that user should select the required value for the lookup Steps Create a new item in the lookup list with lookup column display field value as “(None)”. After this change, “(None)” will be selected by defaut since it will usually be first in the alphabetical order. Since we don’t want an item to be saved with value “(None)”, configure column validation for the lookup column to disallow this value. For SharePoint On Premises, please refer http://www.crowcanyon.info/manuals/webparts/column-validation-settings.htm for more details on configuring column validations. See sample configurations below: For NITRO Forms column validation, please refer https://www.crowcanyon.info/nitro/appmanual_v2/using-enhanced-list-forms.html for more details. See sample configurations below: For Forms Manager (SharePoint Online), please go to Application Administration –> Crow Canyon Apps –> Crow Canyon Forms Manager App –> Select the “Tickets” list, configure a column validation as shown below "

If we copy multiple lines of text from a text editor like notepad, it looks good but when we hit enter in rich text field, it adds an additional line space.

Archival feature moves the old closed Tickets and related list items (like Tasks, Emails etc.) to corresponding ‘archived’ lists. This is usually done to have better performance by keeping only the required items in Tickets list. It also helps in managing the SharePoint list items threshold limit. Archival process works based on the “Request Status” and “Closed Date” column values in the Tickets list items. Note : Archival process deletes items from ‘main’ lists and moves the data to corresponding ‘archived’ lists. Please read the archival feature configurations carefully to avoid any data loss due to the deletion of items in main lists. Archival Settings Service Request Application has archival feature to move old Tickets to a separate list so that your list of active Tickets doesn’t become too large. The old Tickets are put into the ‘Archived Tickets’ list and are fully available in the site for reference and reporting etc. ‘Archival Settings’ list in your site has the required configuration settings to manage the archival process. This includes the lists used in archival and criteria to archive (like archiving after specified number of days once the Ticket has been closed). Tickets list items data is copied into corresponding columns in the Archived Tickets list. Archival feature also moves corresponding related items like associated IT Support Tasks, Email Tickets, and Approver Tasks. We can access Archival Settings under Site Contents. There should only be one item for the Archival Settings list. Do not add another item in this list as this may disrupt the archival process, instead edit the existing item to make the required changes. The Archival Settings are provided with the default values as shown below: Note: Before enabling archival feature, ensure that both “Tickets” and “Archived Tickets” lists has the same set of columns with same data type, internal name and display name. Ensure the same for related lists as well. Missing columns in archival lists can cause data loss during archival process Whenever any change is made to any column in Tickets list, make the same change in “Archived Tickets” list as well. This consistency should be maintained in Tickets and Archived Tickets list to prevent any data loss during archival process Whenever any list names are changed, update the Archival Settings accordingly Archival configurations include below mentioned columns. Please create if any of these columns are not present in ‘Archival Settings’ list in your site Please create the columns with same Internal Names as mentioned in below table. Display name can be changed after creating the column (by editing the column settings). Please ignore if the column already exists in the list Archival Settings List Column Details S. No. Column Internal Name Column Display Name Type of Column Description 1 Title Title Single line of Text Default Value: Archival Settings Note: Do not change the value in this column. 2 SourceTicketListName Source Ticket List Name Single line of Text Name of main ‘Tickets’ list from which items will be moved to archived list. 3 TargetTicketListName Target Ticket List Name Single line of Text Name of Archived Tickets list to which old Ticket items will be moved. 4 SourceEmailListName Source Related List Names Multiple lines of text – Plain Text Tickets list has associated lists like ‘Email Tickets’, ‘IT Support Tasks’ etc. Each of these lists should have a lookup column to Tickets list. Specify name of each of these lists that has to be archived in a separate line in this column. 5 TargetEmailListName Target Related List Names Multiple lines of text – Plain Text Similar to above, there will be associated lists for ‘Archived Tickets’ list having lookup column to ‘Archived Tickets’ list.

If users are not receiving any auto notifications i.e. Notification on Ticket Creation, Assignment, Completion then verify the users (Requester, Assigned Staff, Notify Staff, Assigned Team etc) in Auto Notification utilities in Crow Canyon Application (go to Crow Canyon helpdesk site –>Application Administration –> Notifications–> Notification on Ticket Creation/Assignment/Completion). 2. Check the “Send Mails” list and verify if the unassigned, assigned or closed notification email items are getting created in the list or not. Mails are sent based on items created in this list. To check this go to Site Contents –> Send Mails list -> Verify the items are created in this list (you can search with Ticket CaseId in the “Title”) Ex: Assignment email item in Send Mails list 3. If the send mails items are created but still mails are not received then verify the Workflow logs: Go to Application Administration –> Crow Canyon Nitro Apps –> Nitro Workflow –> Click “Information” on workflows configured on ‘ Send Mails ‘ list and verify if there are any errors. Note: If you have configured other workflows with Send Mail action and mails are not received then check the logs for that workflow similar to above. 4. Add IP address 104.214.52.79 as safe sender in your exchange server. Note that this IP is used for only timer based mails, not the item updated/created/deleted mails. Also add the sender addresses of these mails (from address) as safe senders on your side (you can find the from address in Crow Canyon Application in Notification Utilities, Advanced Emails, Workflow Manager etc.) 5. Check with your exchange administrator if mails are getting blocked at your end. Crow Canyon uses a third party service ‘Send Grid’ for outgoing emails. Crow Canyon support can check logs of this service and provide you information on whether mail is delivered or blocked. If mail is delivered from this service then issue has to be sorted out at your exchange level 6. Refer this FAQ to configure your own mailbox for outgoing emails: https://www.crowcanyon.help/article/349 7. If you still have issues after configuring internal mailbox, please check the logs for below exception. Issue In the NITRO Workflow logs, we see exceptions in Debug log column of log list item. Exception: The SMTP server requires a secure connection or the client was not authenticated. The server response was: 5.7.57 Client not authenticated to send mail. Error: 535 5.7.139 Authentication unsuccessful, Smtp ClientAuthentication is disabled for the Mailbox. Cause This is possible if the mailbox used in NITRO Workflows does not have SMTP Authentication enabled. Resolution Refer https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/authenticated-client- smtp -submission and enable SMTP authentication for the mailbox.

The below scenarios describe how to fix this situation. To learn more about setting up the Email Sync tool, please click here: https://www.crowcanyon.info/nitro/appmanual_v2/configuring-email-sync.html Possible cause of the infinite loop of ticket creation and auto notification: Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE If the email account configured in Email Sync settings (as defined in the “Connection Settings for Microsoft Exchange Server” section from the above link) is used as the “From Address” in either the auto notification settings (under Notifications in Application Administration) or in any Workflow Manager Send Mail action then it is possible that this could create an infinite loop. As an example, if any recipient of the notification is out of office then the mailbox set up in the Email Sync settings will also receive that email. This in turn creates a new ticket, which sends a new email to the out-of-office recipient, etc. Possible cause of duplicate ticket creation: If the account used in Crow Canyon Email Sync settings is used as the Requester, Assigned Staff, or any other field that will get a notification that then leads to the auto notification. Which in turn then creates a new ticket if the mail does not have the [CaseId: (ID)] syntax. How to fix this: Check the below configurations to see if you have any settings that refer to the mailbox/account set up in the Email Sync Settings A. Crow Canyon Workflow manager: (Send Mail Actions) Go to Application Administration –> Crow Canyon NITRO Apps –> Crow Canyon NITRO Workflows App –> edit each workflow and edit each Send Mail Action to make sure the account configured in Email Sync settings is not used in any recipient field (See sample screenshot below): B. Crow Canyon Advanced Email Go to Site Contents –> Tickets list –> List Settings –> Crow Canyon Email Settings and check if the Email Sync mailbox/account is added as a recipient. See sample screenshot below: C. Notifications Utility: Go to Application Administration –> Notifications. Make sure the Email Sync mailbox/account is absent from the Notify Staff field: 2. Always configure “Never Send to” in the Send Mail Action in Workflow Manager workflows to specify the Email Sync mailbox/account: Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE 3. Crow Canyon Email Sync Filters If you use the email account used in Crow Canyon Email Settings as “From Address” in Crow Canyon application outgoing email settings, we need to make sure that the out of office mails are filtered from creating duplicate tickets in Crow Canyon Email Sync settings. Otherwise, when a ticket is created for a user as requester, that user receives auto notification and if that user is out office then out office mail comes to mailbox configured in email sync settings and that creates another ticket and this loop repeats. To prevent this, add a filter condition to restrict creating tickets from automatic replies.

This is a Crow Canyon App/solution and you can refer the features here: https://www.crowcanyon.info/nitro/appmanual_v2/batch-actions.html Symptom 1 After executing the custom action, custom action pop up window is not closing on clicking “Close” button. Cause (specific to SharePoint On-premises) If alternate access mapping URLs are configured for the site then the site can be accessible with different URLs. If users are not using the URL which is used to configure the custom action then this issue may happen. Ex If we have two different URLs for our sites i.e. URL#1, URL#2 and the site can be accessible with both the URLs. If custom actions are configured using URL#1 but if someone is using the URL#2 to open the site and trying to use the custom actions then this behavior can occur. Fix Please use the same URL (which is used to configure the custom action) to access the sites. Symptom 2 Query list action is not working in Custom Actions. Cause This issue can happen if the target list exceeds the list view threshold limit (5000 in SP Online) and the CAML query used in the action requires going through more than the threshold values to return the result. This is standard SharePoint limitation that we cannot run a query that requires going through more than the list view threshold number of items from a list. Query list action will try to fetch the items based on query and if list view threshold limit (i.e. 5000) is hit then it gives an exception and subsequent actions that depend on the output of this query list will not executed. Fix Index the column(s) that are used in the CAML query to fetch the items from the list. Go to Site Contents -> List -> List Settings-> Indexed columns. Purpose of indexing is to reduce the number of items that SharePoint has to scan to return the query result. It is not about the actual number of matching items that are returned by the query, which will usually be much smaller in case of custom actions. For performance reasons, SharePoint will not scan more than the threshold number of items and indexed columns are used to narrow down the item range required to be scanned. If the CAML query is using multiple columns, first condition itself should return less than list view threshold number of items. Symptom 3 Authentication failure error on invoking a SharePoint designer workflow from ‘Invoke Workflow’ action in Custom Actions. Cause This issue can happen if “Workflows can use app permissions” site feature is not activated for the site. Resolution Activate “Workflows can use app permissions” site feature. Instructions 1. Go to the site -> Site Settings -> Manage Site Features (under Site Actions). 2. Click on ‘Activate’ button to activate “Workflows can use app permissions” site feature.

This article is written taking the example of Workflow Manager, exactly same configurations are to be done for Advanced Approval App (except for Graph API). NITRO Workflows by default sends emails using SendGrid service. This can sometimes cause mail delivery issues as SendGrid server IPs may not be trusted by receiving server. Also, mails originating outside of receiving server but with sender address of internal domain has chances of being considered a spam mail. To avoid these issues, NITRO workflows now has the following additional options to send mails. Microsoft Graph API: Refer instructions from this article Mailbox Settings: Explained in current article In case mail delivery by Mailbox / Graph API fails for any reason then SendGrid is used as backup. This can be configured at the site level in Workflow Manager. All workflows configured in the site will use the same settings for outgoing mails. Note : If we need to use a shared mailbox and not the user account, we need to use Graph API method to setup internal mailbox, please refer the article for more details regarding this. Configured mailbox requires permissions to send mails as another user or send mail on behalf of other users. Please refer this article for permission configurations. Refer below image to configure the settings. Details of the settings are described further down: Mailbox settings Please refer below image for the settings. Note the text within the dialog and in the yellow boxes: Send Mail Process Flow Mails are sent as per below process: If Graph API is enabled and mail size is below 3 MB, attempt to send mail via Graph API If mail is not sent via Graph API (skipped or error) and Mailbox settings are enabled, attempt to send mail via Mailbox (refer example scenario below) If mail is not sent via Mailbox (skipped or error) and SendGrid is enabled, attempt to send mail via SendGrid IP Whitelisting When above mailbox settings are enabled, Crow Canyon Workflow Manager component will attempt to send mails. This is done by connecting to the mailbox using Microsoft Exchange Web Services API. Workflow Manager component runs in Microsoft Azure and following IPs should be whitelisted so that mailbox can be connected for sending mails from the services running in Azure South Central US data center. Also, please ensure that multi-factor authentication (MFA) is not enabled for this mailbox account or below IPs are exempted from MFA: IP Addresses: 104.214.52.79 104.44.128.14 104.44.128.15 104.44.128.16 104.44.128.17 40.124.36.136 [August 2019 Update] Also whitelist the following IPs: 13.65.212.252 13.66.37.235 13.66.36.172 13.84.40.155 13.66.37.11 40.84.136.198 23.98.144.222 23.98.128.142 [December 2024 Update] Additional IPs to whitelist: 13.66.37.235 13.66.36.172 13.84.40.155 13.66.37.11 13.65.212.252 40.84.136.198 23.98.144.222 23.98.128.142 20.118.119.70 20.118.112.218 20.118.116.205 20.225.19.181 20.225.16.176 20.225.16.190 20.225.16.209 20.225.17.45 20.225.17.78 20.225.17.88 20.225.17.101 20.225.17.138 Example Scenario Mailbox configuration in NITRO Workflows: If above settings are not enabled, then mail is sent via SendGrid directly. If settings are enabled then first attempt is made to send the mail with sender as the ‘From’ address configured in the Send Mail action (‘Send As’ scenario). If this fails due to any reason like invalid sender account (no-reply@sharepointonline.com), then mail will be sent from the address of the mailbox configured above. And “Reply To” address will be set to the ‘From’ address (no-reply@sharepointonline.com) specified in the Send Mail action settings. If both fail and ‘Use SendGrid’ is set to ‘Yes’ then mail is sent via the SendGrid service. Please note that if ‘Use SendGrid’ is set to ‘No’ then outgoing mails will stop working if send mail via Mailbox fails or is not enabled. Consider following accounts for the example below: Mailbox account is crowcanyonemail@crowcanyon365.com Email address associated with above mailbox is crowcanyonemail@crowcanyon365.com (‘Sender Email’). This could be different than mailbox account in certain cases From address is jamesr@crowcanyon365.com (from address configured in Send mail action in NITRO Workflows) 1. ‘Send As’ Attempt to send mail as jamesr@crowcanyon365.com using the mailbox of crowcanyonemail@crowcanyon365.com login.

To use the property restriction feature on a column, that column needs to be mapped to a Managed Property. This property should be Searchable, Queryable, and Retrievable. Use Case: In Crow Canyon NITRO Forms, we have several options to enhance the lookup columns functionality (under “Advanced” => “Lookup Settings”). Using this we can enable cascading feature to filter ‘child’ lookup as per the selection in ‘parent’ lookup column (for e.g. ‘Country’ lookup column as parent for child lookup column ‘State’). Another feature is to not load the items in the lookup column and instead search the items and then select. This is very useful in scenarios where lookup list has lot of items and form load is slowed down considerably if lookup column is populated at the time of form load. Also, if lookup list has more items than the list view threshold then lookup column will not get loaded at all. With NITRO forms “Do not load lookup list items” feature these problems are addressed as form loads faster and lookup list items can be searched and set in the lookup column even in case of list view threshold exceeded scenario. If search is enabled on the child lookup, then search results should filter out items based on the value selected in the parent column. This is similar to the case where search is not enabled and lookup list items are shown in the drop down. For this to work, parent column in lookup list of child lookup column needs to be a managed property in search schema. For configuring the managed property, please refer below links. To summarise, if cascading is enabled on a child lookup and search is enabled along with do not load option, then it is mandatory to configure managed property.

We have upgraded our applications (IT, Facilities, Requests Management, Purchasing etc.) to take advantage of NITRO capabilities. This article provides the details of upgrading existing applications to new NITRO based versions. Important points to note: Only application settings and configuration are updated, there is no change in application data NITRO Studio needs to be installed in customer site collection. Crow Canyon can assist in this step as required Though there is not much downtime during the upgrade, it is preferable to do this during non-business hours Please refer NITRO Studio Components for more details description about NITRO components. Please refer NITRO Studio Video Library for videos on new NITRO capabilities. Upgrade Process: Prior to upgrading the Crow Canyon application, we need to install the new NITRO Studio and other related apps in the root site of the site collection. Detailed process is described in this article After the NITRO Studio and related apps are installed successfully in the root site of the site collection, please contact sharepointsupport@crowcanyon.com so that our support personnel will schedule a session for the application upgrade. During upgrade session, logged in user should have site collection admin rights If the Workflow Manager is already upgraded then there will be no down time during the NITRO upgrade. Otherwise, there will be around 15-30 minutes downtime depends up on the complexity of configured workflows. Please refer this article for more details about Workflow Manger upgrade process. As part of this upgrade, our old Crow Canyon apps related features will be migrated to our new NITRO Studio based solutions including Forms, Reports etc. There will be no real downtime, however, this migration process takes around 15 minutes so we can consider this as downtime/maintenance window. Next Step is to convert the list forms to NITRO Forms. This conversion will not have any downtime. We will get all the forms configured and then finally publish to convert the forms. After this users will start noticing the form UI changes. Please find the sample screenshots of the list forms before and after upgrade at the end of this article. Note: All the users can continue using the application during this upgrade Email to Ticket conversion functionality will continue to work without any interruptions during this upgrade Old Forms Manager based forms (Tabs on top of standard SharePoint list forms) will be converted to Crow Canyon NITRO Forms Existing categories, issue types, notification utility configurations, quick launch links, top link bar links, Application Administration and all other custom features/configurations will work as is after the upgrade Existing Tickets and other lists data etc. won’t have any impact Screenshot 1: Sample Asset Form before NITRO upgrade Screenshot 2: Sample Asset Form after NITRO upgrade NITRO Upgrade Crow Canyon Applications NITRO Studio About supportTeam View all posts by supportTeam → Related Articles NITRO Studio Workshop: New NITRO Reports Features NITRO Studio Workshop: Building Dashboards with NITRO Studio NITRO Studio Workshop: NITRO Forms & Business Processes NITRO Studio Workshop: How to Use NITRO Forms (Part 2) Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment. © 2025 Crow Canyon Systems, Inc.

Save button text change Cancel button text change How to redirect to custom page URL after submitting the form? Change background color and hover color of the buttons To replace the Save and Cancel buttons, we will use Submit action and Script action buttons in Nitro forms. With these action buttons we can execute the custom script and also we can invoke the configured custom actions in Submit action. This article takes Tickets list as example, you can configure the same on any list. Detailed Instructions Save button text change Go to IT help desk site –> Tickets list –> List Settings –> Crow Canyon Nitro Forms –> Select the desired form (one list can have multiple NITRO Forms configured) Hide the “Save” button under Layouts and Theme section and insert the “Submit Action” button. To insert the submit action button, drag and drop the Submit Action button from “Actions” section to the desired position on the form: Rename Button Title to “Submit work Order” –> enter “ functionCallback(); ” under Script Function panel under action settings like shown in below image. Note: You can specify any text for the button title and select any image To customize the width of the submit button, we can use Custom CSS in NITRO forms. Please go to Advanced section –> Custom CSS –> add below and save the settings. .ccs_btn_SubmitAction{ min-width:150px !important; } Cancel button text change Go to IT help desk site –> Tickets list –> List Settings –> Crow Canyon Nitro Forms –> Select the desired form (one list can have multiple NITRO Forms configured) Hide the “Cancel” button under Layouts and Theme section and insert the “Script Action” button. To insert the script action button, drag and drop the Script Action button from “Actions” section to the desired position on the form. Rename the “Cancel” Button Title as required –> enter “ $('#btnCancel').trigger('onclick'); ” under Script Function panel under action settings like shown in below image. Note: You can specify any text for the button title and select any image To customize the width of the submit button, we can use Custom CSS in NITRO forms. Please go to Advanced section –> Custom CSS –> add below and save the settings. .ccs_btn_ScriptAction{ min-width: 150px !important; } How to redirect to a custom URL after submitting the form? For this we need to configure Post Save settings in submit button action settings in NITRO Forms Permissions Configuration To show this “Submit Work Order” action button only for the specific group of people, we can configure permissions for the action button. Select the button, go to permissions section and configure the permissions as required. Change background color and hover color of the buttons. Navigate to NITRO Forms designer for the list -> Select the previously dragged ‘Submit Action’ button -> Expand ‘Style’ section from the button settings panel. 2. Under the ‘Style’ section, check ‘Override Button Style’ -> Click ‘Edit’ button as shown below: 3. In the opened ‘Style’ pop-up, click ‘Gradient generator’ link under ‘Background Gradient’ as shown below: 4. On the opened page (with URL: https://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/ ), select any gradient from the ‘Presets’ option -> Drag the color slider to generate the required gradient -> Copy the generated CSS as shown below: 5. On the NITRO Forms designer page, paste the copied CSS in ‘Background Gradient’ section as shown below: 6. Similarly, generate the ‘Hover Gradient’ and paste the CSS in ‘Hover Gradient’ section. 7. Click ‘OK’ -> Click ‘Apply’ -> Publish the NITRO Forms. Sample output: If ‘Background Gradient’ and ‘Hover Gradient’ needs to be changed for all the buttons on the NITRO Form and not just for one button, then the below steps can be followed: Navigate to NITRO Forms designer for the list -> Open ‘GLOBAL SETTINGS’ ribbon -> Edit or copy the current theme (or any other theme from the dropdown menu) as shown below: 2. Navigate to ‘Buttons’ tab in ‘Configure Forms Theme’ dialog -> Click ‘Gradient generator’ link under ‘Background Gradient’ -> Select any gradient from the ‘Presets’ option -> Drag the color slider to generate the required gradient -> Copy the generated CSS as shown below: 3. Paste the copied CSS code from above in ‘Background Gradient’ section. 4. Similarly, generate the ‘Hover Gradient’ and paste the CSS in ‘Hover Gradient’ section. 5. Also, check the “Border Radius” setting. The default value is ‘0 px’, increasing this number will increase the amount of rounding on the corners. Sample output for the rounded corners when the ‘Border Radius’ is set "

This is used for cases like recurring maintenance tasks for Assets, renewing Contracts etc. This functionality can be configured using Crow Canyon NITRO Workflows App. In this article, we have taken Tickets list as an example but this can be configured on any list using the Workflow Manager. We will create a recurring schedule list (Calendar list) and then configure a Scheduled workflow to get the recurring items created in the Tickets list. Calendar list has two functions: You can use the standard calendar feature to set the date of occurrence. This could be a one time occurrence or a recurring schedule. For example, if maintenance Ticket has to be created every month then enable the recurrence in the calendar item and set the schedule including end date or number of occurrences etc. While creating the maintenance Ticket, we need to put the required information in the Ticket. We will create additional columns in the Calendar list to hold this information and this is copied to the Ticket at the time of Ticket creation. Summary of Steps Create a Calendar List for recurrence and add columns to put the required information in the Tickets Workflow configuration for creating Tickets as per the recurrence/date specified in the calendar list items Detailed Steps List Schema for Calendar List Create a Calendar type list with name “Recurrence Schedule” (you can give a name of your choice) and create the columns that are used to create the ticket. We can use the calendar recurrence option to set the recurrence schedule for this ticket. Please go to ‘Site Contents’ page of your site, click ‘add an app’ and then search for ‘Calendar’ type list and then create a new list of type ‘Calendar’: Columns to be created in the “Recurrence Schedule” list for this example: Field Internal Name Display Name Field Type Required TicketTitle Ticket Title Single line of text field Yes TicketCategory Ticket Category Lookup to Category list No TicketIssueType Ticket Issue Type Lookup to IssueType list No TicketDescription Ticket Description Multiline text No TicketPriority Ticket Priority Choice (Normal, Low, High`) TicketRequester Ticket Requester Person or group Yes RelatedAsset Related Asset Lookup to Assets list No Please note that above columns are just representative and you can add whatever columns are required as per your use case of creating recurrence items. These columns need to be used in the Workflow later for mapping to the Ticket items that will get created as per the recurring schedule. Sample screenshot for calendar item recurrence for monthly Tickets:   Note : If you want to create maintenance Tickets on specific dates and not as per a recurring schedule then create items in the “Recurrence Schedule” list without checking “Recurrence” column. In this case you can specify the Start Time and End Time and put the date value for the date on which Ticket should be created. Create a separate item in “Recurrence Schedule” list for each specific date on which Ticket should be created   Workflow Configuration Configure a “scheduled” workflow on Recurring Schedule list using our NITRO Workflows App. Create a workflow as shown below:   Configure a “Create Item” action to create a ticket as shown below: View upcoming maintenance Tickets In order to view upcoming recurrence tickets, please go to the Calendar list and check for the next month calendar view.

Lookup column is not populating any values Logged-in user attributes are not auto-populated in Ticket columns Lookup column is not populating any values Issue Though the Lookup list has items in the Back-end site, the lookup column in the portal form is not populating any values. Possible Cause 1 Check if any filter is configured for the lookup column. Resolution Go to Portal Settings, Edit desired list forms, choose the desired form (new/edit), click on “Lookup settings” under “Advanced” section in left hand side panel, edit the desired lookup column, verify the “Cascaded Lookup Settings”. Remove the filter on the lookup column if not needed and check the result. Sample filter condition screenshot below. Possible Cause 2 User does not have at least read permissions on the lookup list Resolution Go to the back end site, open the lookup list –> list settings –> permissions for this list –> grant at least read permissions to the desired group of users. To validate the user permissions before granting, go to lookup list settings, permissions for this list, open “Permissions” in ribbon, click “Check permissions” and verify the permissions (Sample screenshot below) Logged-in user attributes are not auto-populated in Ticket columns In Crow Canyon Service Request applications, Requester user column and other attributes like Requester Email, Phone and Department etc. are auto-populated when user opens the new Ticket form. This information is fetched based on logged-in user from SharePoint User Information list (SP On-premises) or SharePoint user profile (SP Online). Issue User attributes (Email, Phone and Department etc.) are not getting populated in Portal new form Cause This can happen if the logged-in user doesn’t have permissions on SharePoint User information list. Resolution Option 1: If you are using server version of SharePoint On-premises (that is, not SharePoint Foundation), then you can switch to SharePoint user profile for fetching the user information. Please ensure that user profile sync service is configured, and latest user information is available in the user profiles. Please refer this article to configure auto fill settings in NITRO Forms. Option 2: Grant read permission to everyone on SharePoint User Information List. You can use this option if using SharePoint foundation version or user data is not available in SharePoint user profiles. Instructions Go to root site of the site collection where portal is installed -> Site Settings -> People and Groups -> Change the group membership Id to “0” in the URL, as shown below: Next, go to List settings -> Permissions for this list and grant read permission to everyone.

For example, if value of ‘Priority’ column is ‘High’ or if ‘Due Date’ is greater than ‘Today’ date value. In some scenarios, we need to compare the value of a list column with another column of the list item. For example, we want to check if item is created by same user who is currently the user to whom Ticket is assigned (compared ‘Created By’ column with ‘Assigned Staff’ column value). This may be required at the Workflow level or at the action level. In such case we need to use the column placeholders for the value part in conditions as described below: Column placeholder has this syntax: [Display name of column|Internal name of column] You can directly put this syntax in condition or you can use below steps to get the place holder value: In the above example screenshot, we are allowing the workflow execution only if “Created By” is not equal to “Assigned Staff”. We have selected the “Created By” in left drop down and for place holder to insert in right side text box, start configuring a dummy “Create Item” action and click on add field mappings to get the column placeholders. See sample screenshot below. Select the desired column (Assigned Staff in our example) from the bottom list box, click “Add Placeholder to Value”, this inserts the place holder in “Column Value” text box. Copy the whole place holder text, cancel the dummy action, and paste the place holder in the desired condition setting in condition builder. Different type of placeholders/values used in conditions: Possible Value Syntax Example Literal/Custom Values Column Value Resolved Place Holders [Column Display Name|Column Internal Name] [Request Status|RequestStatus] Query List QueryListActionName##[Column Display Name|Column Internal Name] GetApprovalLevel##[Approval Level|ApprovalLevel] Variables VariableName##Value VarTicketID##Value Functions Syntax will be based on function used in condition. $add([Due Date|DueDate],[Created|Created]) Content Types Content Type Name Issue Type NITRO Workflows NITRO Studio- Workflows About supportTeam View all posts by supportTeam → Related Articles NITRO Studio Workshop: Custom Actions and Workflows Revisited NITRO Studio Workshop: Using NITRO Workflows with Teams NITRO Studio Workshop: Introducing the New Looping Feature for Custom Actions and Workflows NITRO Studio Workshop: Building Workflows with the NITRO Workflow Designer Interface Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment. © 2025 Crow Canyon Systems, Inc.

Also we have maintenance tasks that will be created periodically based on the scheduled preventive maintenance feature for the assets. This article describes how to update “Total Maintenance Cost” in Asset with the sum of its related maintenance tasks cost. Summary of Steps: Configure a workflow on “Tasks” list on “an item is created” event that finds all the related tasks and update the total cost. Configure a workflow on “Tasks” list on “an item is modified” event that finds all the related tasks and update the total cost. Detailed Steps: Configure a workflow on “Tasks” list on “an item is created” event that finds all the related tasks and update the total cost. Step 1: Open Workflow manager and configure a new workflow on “Tasks” list on “Item is created” event as shown below Step 2: Configure a Query List Action as shown below Query used in above action: <View> <Query> <Where> <Eq> <FieldRef Name='Asset' LookupId='TRUE' /> <Value Type='Lookup'>##Asset##</Value> </Eq> </Where> </Query> </View>   Step 3: Configure an “Update Item” actin to update the “Total Maintenance Cost” for the Asset list as shown below Column Value in the above field mapping: <<todo>> Syntax: QueryListActionName##$sum(Task Cost from tasks columns) The above field mapping is build using the “Column Mapping” dialog as shown below. With the above workflow configuration, on every task creation, it fetches all the related tasks for the asset, sums up all the related task cost and updates in the Total Maintenance Cost. 2. Configure a workflow on “Tasks” list on “an item is modified” event that finds all the related tasks and update the total cost.

These are used to create a new item in list, edit an existing item and see the details of an existing item respectively. In NITRO terminology a combination of these three is called a ‘Form’. NITRO allows multiple ‘Forms’ on a list with each having its own set of form features such tabs/sections, columns, validations, permissions, lookup and associated list settings, e-signature etc. That is, on the same underlying list and columns we can have different types of forms as per the business requirement. Within each ‘Form’, we can use a single configuration to define the New, Edit and Display forms. If there are slight variations then column permissions can be used to differentiate the forms. For example, a tab can be hidden from the New form by using the condition ‘ID is Empty’ if rest of the tabs and fields are same for all three. Alternatively, we can create separate configuration for New/Edit/Display forms for the same ‘Form’ if there is significant difference in the form layout or functionality. For New/Edit/Display, we can use the NITRO system designed form that just includes all the visible fields in a simple layout or use the custom design to define the form as required with all the features mentioned above. In this article, we have described different possible scenarios and also sample use cases.   Typical Scenarios S. No. Form Configuration Description 1 Single ‘Form’ with same form for New/Edit/Display and using Custom Design This is the most common scenario where standard SharePoint forms are replaced with NITRO forms for enhanced functionality. It is used where list items are essentially of same type and can be managed with a single form. If any variation is required on the form based on the item data, then that is done using column and tab level permissions 2 Single ‘Form’ with same form for New/Edit/Display and using System Design This can be used for simple lists with few fields. Here system designed simple form is sufficient and extra features are not required. This can be used in cases like Associated Items. For example when creating associated Tasks for a Ticket 3 Single ‘Form’ with different form for New/Edit/Display and using Custom Design If there is significant difference between New/Edit/Display forms then it is better to design separate forms. Advantage of this approach is that each form can have a totally different set of form features (like tabs, columns, permissions etc.). Though, this can be achieved with use of conditions in column and tab permissions, having separate forms gives more flexibility and keeps the form configurations simple. However, if you make a change in say New form and need the same change in Edit form as well, then you will need to change configurations for both forms separately 4 Multiple ‘Form’s with same/different form for New/Edit/Display and using Custom Design This is required when same list is used to store different types of items. These items will have few common attributes and many different attributes that will depend on the type of item. For e.g. in a Request Management solution, same ‘Request’ list is used to store substantially different types of requests like a request for name correction vs. an related to salary. Here different set of New/Edit/Display forms can be created for different types of requests. Layout and columns shown in the forms will be as per the data required for the specific request types. Within each request type, same or different forms can be used for New/Edit/Display depending on how much variation is required in these forms. Please note that, NITRO Forms automatically uses the correct form to edit and display the item depending on which form was used to create the item 5 Associated Items NITRO Forms support showing the associated or linked items on the Form. For example, for a Task list with lookup to Request list, the Request item form can show all the related Tasks associated with current request item. Also, new Tasks can be created for current item and existing ones edited. If you need a separate form for Tasks list for this scenario, then configure a new Form for Task list with required configurations and specify it in the associated item settings of Request list form. Important things to note Every list has default Form with the name of the list. In Nitro/Portal forms, list items will be opened in the same Form that is used to create them Every Form has its own unique identifier. This unique identifier is saved in the item when it is created from the particular New form. When opening the item in Display/Edit form, this identifier is used to open in corresponding form In case there is no "

Summary of Steps: Configure a custom action “Copy Item” with “Create Item” function in back end site. Configure portal form with “Create Item” action button and invoke the “Copy Item” custom action. Detailed Steps: Configure a custom action “Copy Item” with “Create Item” function in back end site This action creates a new item with the values from the existing item. Columns to copy new item are configurable in “Create Item” function. Go to Tickets list –> list Settings –> Crow Canyon Custom Actions –> Configure “Copy Item” custom actions as shown below Custom action: Add List Item: 2. Configure portal form with “Create Item” action button and invoke the “Copy Item” custom action. This step adds a new button in portal Ticket’s display form that allows creating a new ticket from an existing ticket. We can add desired conditions so this button appears based on the existing ticket state. In Display Form: Go to Portal Site –> Portal Forms –> Edit Tickets list forms –> Switch to Display form –> Drag and drop the “Custom Action” action button on to the form at a desired position –> Rename the “Button Title” to desired value and select the “Copy Item” custom action (i.e. configured in above step) from the dropdown under “Action Settings” section and Click Apply (See screenshot below). In Edit Form: We can configure this “Create Item” action button in portal Ticket’s edit form as well. Go to Portal Site –> Portal Forms –> Edit Tickets list forms –> Switch to Edit form –> Drag and drop the “Submit Action” button on to the form at a desired position –> Rename the “Button Title” to desired value and select the “Copy Item” custom action (i.e. configured in the above step) from the dropdown under “Action Settings” section and click Apply (see screenshot below) Additional Configuration: For example, if we would like to show this “Copy Item” custom action button only for the Closed tickets, then we can configure permissions for the action button. Select the button, go to permissions section, add two permission, “show when Request Status equal to Closed” and “hide when Request Status not equal to Closed”. "

Here Issue Type values get filtered based on selected Category. In some cases we require an additional filter at the top level to get the Category values filtered. In this article, we will call this top level filter column as ‘Main Category’. When this Main Category value is changed, it filters the Category values. This article lists the steps to add this feature. Please note that in certain cases you may add third level at the bottom, that is, it will be like a ‘Sub Issue Type’ that will get filtered based on the selected Issue Type. You can apply the same technique as explained in this article, that is create the new column and filter it based on the parent column Issue Type. Summary of Steps Create a custom list (Main Category) and populate the required values in the Title field Configure a lookup column in Tickets list pointing to Title field of “Main Category” list Configure a new lookup column in “Category” list pointing to Title field of “Main Category” list Add the Main Category field to the Ticket and Category list forms to be displayed above the “Category” field Configure the cascaded lookup settings for the “Category” column to get filtered based on the selection of “Main Category” (for both Tickets and Category lists) Detailed Steps Go to Site Contents –> Add an app –> Add a custom list –> name it as per the requirement. In this article we are assuming “Main Category” as the list name. Go to “Tickets” list –> List settings –> Create a lookup column pointing to “Title” field of the “Main Category” list. See Sample screenshot below Similar to #2 above, go to “Category” list –> List settings –> Create a lookup column pointing to Title field in the Main Category list. Go to Tickets list –> List settings –> Crow Canyon NITRO Forms –> select the list form (New/Edit) and add the Main Category Column to the list form at the required position. Go to create column button and click on ‘Create Lookup Column’ to filter Category based on selection of “Main Category”. See sample screenshot below: With the above configurations, three level filtering will be done in the backend forms. If the same three level filtering is to be implemented in the portal forms as well, repeat #4 and #5 in the NITRO Forms for the Portal site.

    "text": " Data security in NITRO Apps Data security in NITRO Apps 1635 views 7 min , 9 sec read 5 Introduction This article describes the data flow in NITRO Apps and the related security aspects. Different scenarios are considered and described in terms of data storage, access and flow. Please contact Crow Canyon support if you need any additional information for any particular App or scenario. Client Side Apps Most of the NITRO Apps are implemented entirely in JavaScript, e.g. NITRO Forms, Reports, Power Portal etc. In this case data doesn’t flow outside of SharePoint and there are no additional security considerations except for what are there for standard SharePoint functionality. Please note following points: NITRO App code runs in the browser entirely. There is no component that is running outside of the browser or outside of user machine Crow Canyon services running in Azure are not involved except for the license check. Script code calls the Crow Canyon licensing service that is running in Microsoft Azure to check if license is valid. For this it passes the Site URL and App Name and gets back the license status value (Trial including date/Expired/Product etc.). No user information or site data is passed as part of this check NITRO App code uses standard SharePoint JavaScript API (JSOM) to read the data stored in SharePoint lists wherever required for the App functionality NITRO App code doesn’t collect any statistics, site data or user information and doesn’t pass it to any outside server Code runs in the context of user who is logged in to the SharePoint site and the data user can access is limited by the permissions he has via the SharePoint permissions Crow Canyon Workflow Manager and Approval Workflow There are two types of Workflows from the data security perspective. We will use the abbreviation WF to refer to the Crow Canyon Workflow Application that is running in Microsoft Azure. Event Based Workflows These workflows are triggered on specific events in SharePoint like when a SharePoint list item is created or modified. Many business processes are configured to run on these events and data security is explained for this by taking a sample scenario: Scenario : Send a mail to user when an existing Ticket is assigned to them Workflow Configuration : On Tickets list, create a workflow on item updated event. If ‘Assigned Staff’ user field value has changed and there is a valid user specified, then send a mail with predefined format and Ticket details to the user specified in the ‘Assigned Staff’ column in the Ticket item. Please note that this Workflow configuration doesn’t have any data related to actual Tickets or the users, it is just based on the List name, event, column names and mail format with placeholders for Ticket columns etc. Data Storage : Tickets item data is there in SharePoint just like any other list data and is accessible to users via login to SharePoint. Workflow configuration details are stored in Crow Canyon Azure Database as Xml/JSON and is not encrypted Data Flow – Versioning is enabled on List : Manager user who is logged into SharePoint edits a Ticket and specifies the name of the staff user who should be working on the Ticket. After entering the required data in Ticket edit form, manager clicks Save button Workflow web application (WF app) running in Azure receives an event with details of list and item that is being updated Since versioning is enabled on list, SharePoint will maintain the item column values in previous version of the item (before change). There is no need to store item data to Crow Canyon Azure database Ticket Save operation completes and Ticket item is modified and has the new user in ‘Assigned Staff’ column WF app receives an event with details of list and item that is updated WF app reads the Tickets item data again using same process and keeps it in memory (not stored in any persistent medium). Same is done for the previous version of the item data Item is updated at this point so this is the Ticket data after the Manager user has modified it (after change) As per the workflow configuration, WF app verifies if ‘Assigned Staff’ value has changed and there is a valid user value in it. This is done by comparing the two sets of data that the WF App has for the Ticket. ‘Before change’ data that is read from previous version of item, and ‘after change’ data from latest version. Both of these are in memory and not stored anywhere If ‘Assigned Staff’ value has changed then prepare the email content by replacing Ticket column values in the mail format that is stored as part of workflow configuration Connect to Microsoft Exchange server specified in WF settings for the current site and send the mail In memory data is discarded automatically by the Microsoft ASP.Net framework Data Flow – Versioning is not enabled on List : Manager user who is logged into SharePoint edits a Ticket and specifies the name of the staff user who should be working on the Ticket.

Important Note: Portal feature “Crow Canyon Configurable Portal” and its dependency feature “Crow Canyon Forms Attachments” need to be re-activated only for the portal sub site. All other “Web” scoped features needs to be activated to the back end site. Configure NITRO Forms To start configuring NITRO Forms for a list, please go to list settings –> Click on Crow Canyon NITRO Forms. It prompts to select whether to use NITRO Forms or native SharePoint Forms. “Use Native SharePoint Forms” option uses the forms configured using the forms manager solution. To proceed with NITRO Forms configurations, please select “Use NITRO Forms” and click ok as shown in the below screenshot. Once we choose the “NITRO Forms” in the above step, the NITRO Forms settings page (designer surface) appears and the NITRO Forms will be set as default forms. However, we do not want to make the NITRO Forms as default forms until all the required configurations are complete so the users can keep use the current system without any downtime. To continue configuring the NITRO Forms while users are using the current system, go to Form Settings in the top menu –> click on “Use Native SharePoint Forms” and uncheck the “Close Forms Designer” option and click on Ok. This will set the default forms as native SharePoint Form but will allow us to continue design the NITRO Forms for the list. See sample screenshot below Please refer sample video tutorials in managing NITRO Forms from https://www.nitro.studio/video-library/ Refer the forms manager settings like tabs and columns, advanced column permissions, advanced column validations and design the NITRO Forms accordingly. Previous forms manager configurations are common for all different forms (new form, display form and edit forms), and in our NITRO Forms, we can use different forms similar to standard SharePoint or we can use the same form configuration. Different areas to consider in NITRO Forms configurations: Tabs and Tab Permissions – https://www.nitro.studio/advanced-approvals-video/ Column Permissions – h ttps://www.nitro.studio/advanced-approvals-video/ Column Validations – https://www.nitro.studio/advanced-approvals-video/ Cascaded Lookup Settings – https://www.nitro.studio/nitro-forms-video/ Associated Item Settings Auto-Fill User Information Settings – https://www.nitro.studio/user-info-filler-video/ Let us take an example use case where “Case Id” column needs to be hidden in the New Form and make it read-only in edit form. In such cases we cannot use the same form configuration. We need to split the forms as described below. Before splitting the forms, first configure all the tabs and columns by referring the forms manager configurations and then go to “Form Settings” in the menu –> Click on use different forms and select the custom design option. See sample screenshot below. This splits the single form to multiple forms for the list and copies the same configuration to all three forms (new, display and edit forms). Now, configure all the required unique configurations like the above example “Hide ‘Case Id’ in new form and make it read-only in edit form” and save the configuration. Please make sure that we are not publishing the forms until all the lists are configured. Once all the lists are configured, we can then Publish NITRO Forms for all the required lists. This sets the NITRO forms as default forms for all these lists.

Using Crow Canyon Linked Items App these mails are directly available on the main list item forms (and views) for easy referencing. ‘Crow Canyon Email Sync’ App enables incoming emails to be brought into SharePoint and then be linked to the corresponding items in business list. These emails are also available on the main list item form like outgoing emails. Incoming email can also trigger a business flow depending on the mail content (e.g. closing a Ticket) using Crow Canyon Workflow Manager App. Mail content can be added to a multi-line column in main list and a notification can be sent to the concerned person for further action when a mail is received. Pre-requisites An announcement type list for the incoming and outgoing email items Above list should have a lookup column to the main business list (in this FAQ, we will take example of a Contracts list) Summary of steps Activate NITRO on the site having the Contract list Note: If you are using non-NITRO based site then ensure that Email Sync and Advanced Email Apps are installed in the site Configure Crow Canyon Email Sync settings to enable incoming emails Configure Crow Canyon Advanced Email Settings for outgoing emails Configure Email History in Contracts site Configure a workflow using Crow Canyon Workflow Manager to link the incoming emails to the corresponding contracts Detailed Instructions 1. Activate NITRO on the site having the Contract list Go to root site –> Crow Canyon Nitro Studio and activate the Nitro for the site having the Contract list Note: If you are using non-Nitro based site then ensure that Email Sync and Advanced Email Apps are installed in the site If you do not have the Crow Canyon Email Sync App, please contact Crow Canyon Support (crowcanyonsupport@crowcanyon.com) to get the latest Crow Canyon Email Sync App. Refer instructions to add Crow Canyon Email Sync App to the App Catalog site from: https://www.crowcanyon.info/nitro/appmanual_v2/install-package-in-appcatalog.html After adding Crow Canyon Email Sync App to the App Catalog site, add the Crow Canyon Email Sync app to root site. 2. Configure Crow Canyon Email Sync settings to enable incoming emails Please refer instructions to configure Crow Canyon Email Sync App settings from: https://www.crowcanyon.info/nitro/appmanual_v2/configuring-email-sync.html 3. Configure Crow Canyon Advanced Email Settings for outgoing emails Please refer Email Manager section in below link to configure the Advanced Email settings for outgoing emails and email history etc. https://www.crowcanyon.info/nitro/appmanual_v2/ 4. Configure Email History in Contracts site Since Email list has a lookup to the Contract list, related emails for a Contract can be shown in the list view of Contracts and also in the Contract item forms. Please refer Linked Items App documentation for more details: https://www.crowcanyon.info/nitro/appmanual_v2/configuring-linked-items.html At a high level, following needs to be done: Create “Email History” multiline text column and configure Associated item Settings in the Nitro forms.

If we need to show particular quick link only to users present in a SharePoint group, we need to configure a script for the quick link to achieve this. Summary of Steps: Create the required quick link in the Portal site. Please refer instructions to create the quick link to auto populate with certain category and issue type from #3 in https://www.crowcanyon.help/article/197/ Configure custom script to show/hide for the users present in the SharePoint group. Detailed Steps: After the Portal quick tile is configured in the Portal settings, we can configure a custom script for the required tile to achieve this feature. Please go to the Portal site –> Portal settings–> Home Page Settings –> Quick Links –> Edit the required quick link –> Click on “Custom JavaScript” –> enter the below script in the script function and click on Ok and save the settings. See sample screenshots below Script: $.ajax({ url: _spPageContextInfo.webAbsoluteUrl + '/_api/web/currentuser/?$expand=groups', method: \"GET\", contentType: \"application/json;odata=verbose\", headers: { \"Accept\": \"application/json;odata=verbose\" } }).done(function(data) { var groupNames = ['SharePoint Group Name']; var userGroups = data.d.Groups.results; var foundInGroups = userGroups.filter(function(g){ return groupNames.indexOf(g.LoginName) > -1}); if(!foundInGroups || foundInGroups.length == 0){ $(\"#\" + paramTileInfo.Guid).remove(); }else{ functionCallback(paramTileInfo); } }) .fail( function(error){ console.log(JSON.stringify(error)); functionCallback(paramTileInfo); }) Note: Please specify the required SharePoint group name in the above script at “Var groupNames” variable so the quick link appears in the portal only for the members present in this SP group. Additional Information: – If we need to show this tile to multiple SharePoint Groups, then replace the “Var groupNames” variables in the script like below – var groupNames = [‘SharePoint Group Name’,’Other SharePoint Group Name’]; Home Tile Portal Power Portal Quick Tile Crow Canyon Applications How-To Power Portal About supportTeam View all posts by supportTeam → Related Articles NITRO Studio Workshop: New NITRO Reports Features NITRO Studio Workshop: Building Dashboards with NITRO Studio NITRO Studio Workshop: NITRO Forms & Business Processes NITRO Studio Workshop: How to Use NITRO Forms (Part 2) Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment. © 2025 Crow Canyon Systems, Inc.

    "text": " Email flow in Crow Canyon SharePoint Online Helpdesk application Email flow in Crow Canyon SharePoint Online Helpdesk application 1343 views 1 min , 50 sec read 1 Applies to: SharePoint Online Description This article describes incoming and outgoing email flow in Crow Canyon helpdesk applications. Email flow in crow canyon application involves Email to Ticket Conversion Outgoing Emails using Crow Canyon Email Incoming Email capture (linking email to an existing ticket) Detailed information 1. Email To Ticket Conversion Crow Canyon Email to Ticket conversion works using Crow Canyon Email Sync and Product App. Crow Canyon Email Sync app reads the new messages from the configured mailbox and creates an item in “Email Tickets” list in our application. Crow Canyon Product app captures the email item created in SharePoint Email Tickets list and creates an item in “Tickets” list if there is no case id syntax present in the email subject. Subject of the email will be set as “Title” on the Ticket. Body of the email will be set as “Description” column on the ticket. Sender of the email will be set as “Requester” on the ticket. If the sender is an external user (not a valid SharePoint user), the sender email address will be set on the “Additional Requester Email” column on the ticket. Once the ticket is created in “Tickets” list, auto notifications will be sent to the requester (sender) and other configured recipients with the predefined mail template (case id syntax in mail subject) in “Notification on Ticket Creation” utility. Refer below article for more details about “Crow Canyon Email Sync” app configurations. https://www.crowcanyon.info/nitro/appmanual_v2/index.html?configuring-email-sync.html Refer this article for using the email address configured in Crow Canyon Email Sync app as from address so whenever user reply back to the auto notifications, they are captured in the “Email History” of the ticket. 2. Outgoing Emails using Crow Canyon Email “Crow Canyon Email” button available in “Tickets” list form ribbon can be used by technician to send email to users directly from SharePoint. This “Crow Canyon Email” action sends outgoing email to the selected recipients and at the same time it captures the history in “Email Tickets” based on the configurations. If we configure the “From Address” with the “email address” configured in email sync setting then whenever user reply they directly comes to mailbox and that will be processed to link with existing ticket. Please refer “Email Manager” section in below article for more details about “Crow Canyon Email” configurations. https://www.crowcanyon.info/nitro/appmanual_v2/index.html?configuring-email-settings.html Note: If we configure email sync setting mailbox address as “From Address”, then there is a chance that if the recipient configures the out of the box auto reply then these mails comes to mailbox but they should not create duplicate/junk tickets. To address this, please configure the Email Filters settings in “Email Sync” settings. 3. Incoming Email capture (linking email to an existing ticket) When users reply to auto notifications and/or email sent using “Crow Canyon Email” action button that has case id syntax in the subject, that reaches to “Email Tickets” list using Crow Canyon Email Sync app. Crow Canyon Product app catches this email and links the email to “Ticket” and is available in “Email History” in the ticket.   Note: If outgoing emails are not working in Crow Canyon application, please refer outgoing emails troubleshooting article from: https://www.crowcanyon.help/article/341/   "

Rich text control not wrapping up in the column 401 unauthorized error appearing for NITRO Apps Portal Forms configured for the Tickets list does not appear in NITRO Forms Modal Dialog not opening in Custom Actions and NITRO Forms Designer pages Symptom 1: In multiple lines of enhanced rich text control, data is coming in a single row instead of multiple lines. In other words text wrap is not happening (see screenshot below) Cause: If we copy the information from a browser and paste into the rich text column directly, html tags like “<pre>” will also be copied along with the text and that could cause these type of issues. If <Pre> tag present in the html source code of the multiline rich text control then this issue should happen. Fix: Remove the <Pre> tag from html source code of the multiline rich text column. Edit the item and remove the <Pre> tag in the html source code. Sample screenshot: Preventive Action: To prevent this issue, work around is to copy the information to a notepad and then paste this information into the multiple lines of rich text column Symptom 2: Crow Canyon NITRO Apps (NITRO Studio, Power Portal, Email Sync, Advanced Approvals) does not open and throws 401 unauthorized error even for site collection Administrator access Cause: Global Admin can set the access control settings in the tenancy to allow only certain IP Addresses, and this issue could happen certain IP Addresses that our Crow Canyon Apps use are also blocked. Resolution: Our Crow Canyon Apps use certain IP addresses and these need to be added to the SharePoint Administration Access Control to get the apps working. Note that all these IP addresses are from Microsoft Azure data centers where Crow Canyon Apps are hosted. IP Address to be allowed: 4.151.16.183,4.156.176.15,4.156.176.32,4.156.176.34,4.156.176.53,4.156.176.83,4.156.176.107, 4.156.176.139,4.156.176.191,4.156.176.214,4.156.176.221,4.156.176.228,4.156.177.93,4.156.177.146, 4.249.144.27,13.64.111.53,13.64.111.83,13.64.111.88,13.65.212.252,13.66.36.172,13.66.37.11,13.66.37.235, 13.84.40.155,13.84.55.90,13.84.129.10,13.89.172.2,20.62.137.12,20.62.142.154,20.66.67.46,20.66.68.19,20.66.68.27, 20.66.68.120,20.66.69.89,20.66.70.135,20.75.145.80,20.75.150.123,20.75.150.159,20.75.150.168,20.75.150.205, 20.75.150.206,20.75.150.211,20.75.150.226,20.75.151.8,20.75.151.29,20.75.151.99,20.75.151.170,20.75.151.173, 20.75.151.231,20.94.150.147,20.94.151.109,20.94.151.161,20.94.151.251,20.114.80.165,20.114.81.54,20.118.112.218, 20.118.116.205,20.118.119.70,20.119.0.45,20.168.147.125,20.168.147.153,20.168.147.216,20.168.147.225,20.168.148.8, 20.221.41.255,20.221.45.181,20.221.45.212,20.221.45.234,20.221.45.243,20.221.45.248,20.221.45.250,20.221.46.19, 20.221.46.24,20.221.46.84,20.221.46.88,20.221.46.94,20.225.16.176,20.225.16.190,20.225.16.209,20.225.17.45,20.225.17.78, 20.225.17.88,20.225.17.101,20.225.17.138,20.225.19.181,20.236.162.63,20.245.208.27,20.253.146.226,23.98.128.142, 23.98.144.222,23.99.133.160,23.99.229.34,23.99.231.53,23.101.112.78,23.101.117.42,40.83.147.125,40.84.136.198,40.88.197.12, 40.112.243.97,40.119.12.75,52.152.96.63,52.152.96.132,52.152.96.170,52.152.97.38,52.152.97.112,52.152.97.159,52.152.97.202, 52.152.98.54,52.152.98.95,52.152.98.244,52.152.98.251,52.152.99.55,52.152.99.56,52.152.99.104,52.152.99.215,52.152.100.37, 52.152.100.50,52.152.100.69,52.152.100.75,52.152.100.76,52.152.100.78,52.152.100.99,52.152.100.106,52.152.100.116, 52.152.100.119,52.152.100.120,52.152.100.203,52.152.100.232,52.152.100.247,52.153.120.144,52.153.120.252, 52.153.121.79,52.153.121.89,52.153.121.176,52.153.121.231,52.171.127.103,52.171.127.129,52.171.127.135, 52.171.127.140,52.171.127.142,52.171.127.145,52.249.32.54,52.249.60.60,65.52.33.205,104.42.209.107, 104.44.128.13,104.44.128.14,104.44.128.15,104.44.128.16,104.44.128.17,104.45.222.255,104.45.223.170,104.45.223.179, 104.210.148.43,104.214.118.162,138.91.140.114,138.91.142.39,138.91.144.81,138.91.145.153,138.91.145.239,138.91.145.243, 138.91.147.198,138.91.148.104,138.91.150.212,138.91.151.27,138.91.187.142,138.91.188.46,138.91.189.187,138.91.189.240, 138.91.190.35,138.91.190.47,138.91.190.217,138.91.191.145,168.61.6.36,168.61.6.126,168.61.189.180,168.61.214.234, 168.62.209.142,191.236.106.123,191.239.49.193,191.239.50.228,191.239.52.104,191.239.53.140 Please go to O365 Admin Center –> SharePoint Admin Center –> Policies –> Access Control –> Network Location and add the above IP Addresses.

Bot “learns’ from resolved and unresolved cases to get better at solving user problems over time. Click here to see more detailed diagram. This article describes the steps to configure the Crow Canyon Bot application. Detailed Steps There are four steps to configure the Bot. Bot Application Configuration Email Domain Configuration Bot Analytics Configurations Bot Channels Getting started to configure the Bot application: Go to the site collection root site, open the Crow Canyon NITRO Studio, that takes us to “NITRO Admin Home” page. Click on the “AI Applications” link available on the top link bar section, this navigates us to the page that shows existing configurations and we can start new configuration from the same page. Click on “New Bot Application” link to get started. 1. Bot Application Configuration 1.a. Site Configuration Title : If bot is used for multiple applications then users select the application for which they need assistance for (e.g. “IT HelpDesk”, “Request Management” etc.). It should be unique across tenancy Application Type : Type of the application for which this bot is configured Site : SharePoint Site where Crow Canyon application is installed. This is used for searching the solution and creating Ticket/Request/Work Order etc. Once the Crow Canyon application site is selected, all the other properties “Knowledge Base List”, “Sort Column”, “Tickets List”, “Category Column”, “Issue Type Column”, “Description Column”, “Requester Column”, and “Requester Email Column” options will be auto populated. 1.b. Knowledge Base List Configurations Knowledge Base List : Bot will search this list for the solutions based on user input text Knowledge Base Display Form URL: It auto populates the KB list’s back end default form URL, if required we can replace with corresponding portal form URL. It supports ##ItemID## placeholder to construct the URL. Category Column: This column is used to search KB articles with matched pass phrases that are resolved to categories Issue Type Column: This column is also used to search KB articles with matched pass phrases that are resolved to issue types Sort Column : This column is used to sort the KB articles when top 5 articles are required to be shown to user Sort Order : Sorting order for KB articles for the above sort column 1.c. Tickets List Configurations Ticket List: This list configuration is used for two different purposes. Used for creating Ticket/Request/Work Order as per user input when problem is not resolved. Used to find solutions based on existing items for similar problems For Ticket/Request/Work Order Creation, select below mentioned columns: Ticket Display Form URL It auto populates the Ticket list’s back end default form URL, if required we can replace with corresponding portal form URL. It supports ##ItemID## placeholder to construct the URL. Category Column Issue Type Column Description Column Requester Column Requester Email Column Status Column Used to search for tickets that are resolved (Resolved/Closed based on Resolved Status value configured) and find the linked KB articles to the result resolved tickets and show in search results in Bot. Resolved Status Value Archived Tickets List Crow Canyon application has archival feature to address SharePoint list view threshold and performance. Multiple archived tickets list can be configured in the application based on the tickets frequency. This configuration in Bot application configuration is used to search archived tickets in addition to tickets data and find the linked KB articles and show them in search result in Bot. 1.d. LUIS Application Configuration LUIS Application : Please create the LUIS application and specify the details after selecting custom option. Details of creating LUIS application are given below. Default is only for testing purpose and should not be used for production bot. To create the LUIS application, refer Creating LUIS App section in this article below. Application Key : The ID of your LUIS application Subscription Key : Authoring Key, available in Luis.ai site under Account Settings Entity for Category : Define Entity name that has the values for Ticket/Request/Work Order. We need to enter the categories entity name that we have configured in the Luis application. 1.e. Search Schema Manage Properties: More Info Search discovers information by crawling items on your site. The discovered content and metadata are called properties of the item. The search schema has a list of crawled properties that helps the crawler decide what content and metadata to extract. Related KB Articles : E"

Erro Details: Login failed for the user the user ‘User Account’. Cause: SQL authentication is set to Windows Authentication mode only. Resolution: Set mixed mode authentication in SQL by following below steps and restart the CrowCanyon Data Sync service. Steps to enable the Mixed Mode Authentication: Open SQL Server Management Studio Express. Choose Windows Authentication from the Authentication drop down list. Click Connect to open the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio Express window. Right-click the SQL instance and choose Properties to open the Server Properties – window. Click Security on the left hand side. Choose both SQL Server and Windows Authentication Mode on the right side. Click OK to close the Server Properties – window. Right-click the SQL instance and choose Restart . Click Yes to restart the SQL server. Validation: To check the authentication, logon to the SQL studio with SQL Authentication mode and it should allow logging in without any errors. Issue Symptom 2: Crow Canyon Data Sync service runs but no items from the database will be synced in SharePoint. This generally happens when some of the files like .exe, .dll are downloaded from the browser and are not trusted. In this case, we do not see any error but the items sync will not start at all. Cause: Crow Canyon Data Sync service has dependency assembly files “Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.dll, Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.Runtime.dll” and they should present in the service installation folder and they are missed. Resolution: Stop Crow Canyon Data Sync service, place the missing dependency files in the installation folder, start the Crow Canyon Data Sync service. Also, unblock all the package files in the installation folder by following below steps. Right Click on the “Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.dll “ file, click properties, if “Unblock” button is visible under “General” tab at the bottom in the security column, click unblock. See sample screenshot below. Repeat the above steps for all the files in the installation folder (Configuration.xml, CrowCanyon.DBSyncService.exe, InstallUtil.exe, Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.dll and Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.Runtime.dll).

This can be done based on some other parameter instead of Category and also can be applied in general to any list in NITRO based applications. In this article, we have considered a use case of “Payroll” Category. If a Ticket is created with Payroll Category, we would like to grant permissions to Payroll SharePoint group only. Summary of Steps Configure a workflow on Ticket creation event that breaks the permissions inheritance and grants specific permissions to required SharePoint user(s) or group(s) Configure a workflow on Ticket update event that breaks the permissions inheritance and grants specific permissions to required SharePoint user(s) or group(s) Detailed Steps 1. Go to Application administration –> Crow Canyon NITRO Apps –> Crow Canyon NITRO Workflows and create a new workflow on Tickets list for “item added” event as shown in screenshot below:   Configure “Manage Permission” action to grant permissions for the required users/SharePoint groups for the Payroll Category: 2. Create another workflow on Tickets list on “item modified” event with the same configurations as described above with an additional condition i.e. Category equals “afterchange:Payroll”. This workflow will be triggered if Category of the Ticket is changed to “Payroll” and hence specific permissions need to be granted.

How to implement Crow Canyon Ticketing System for different departments? 3861 views 2 min , 17 sec read 0 Applies To: SharePoint Online and SharePoint On-Premises Description: Generally permissions can be configured at the root site as sub sites inherit the permissions unless the permissions are broken. There might be cases where we need to have unique permissions for some of the lists. In such case, we can go for the list settings –> Permissions for the list and grant unique permissions on the list by breaking the inheritance from the parent (sub site/root site). Also there are standard SharePoint item level permissions settings for the list like whether to show/hide the items created by the users. To enable this setting, please go to list settings –> Advanced Settings –> Item level permissions section and configure the required option. If the above doesn’t satisfy the requirement and if we need to grant unique permissions for the list items based on certain value in the ticket on ticket creation/update, we can configure them using our NITRO Workflows. We have “Manage Permissions” action that has the ability to set the unique permissions for the list items created with required criteria based on Department/Category of the ticket on ticket creation/update as needed Different Possible Solutions: Case 1: If anyone from any department can access Tickets from the Tickets list but the Tickets need to be segregated as per the value in ‘Assigned Staff’ and ‘Assigned Team’ column. Crow Canyon List View can be configured to display tickets based upon the ‘Assigned Staff’ and ‘Assigned Team’ column value. It will show Tickets assigned to the logged-in user based upon any of the following conditions: Tickets that are directly assigned to the logged-in user. That is, logged-in user is specified in the ‘Assigned Staff’ column. Logged-in user is the member of those SharePoint group(s) that are specified in ‘Assigned Team’ column of the Tickets. This ensures that users can see their assigned Tickets or their team’s Tickets for efficient management and tracking. Detailed steps In this example, we have taken ‘Tickets’ list. Configure Crow Canyon List View on Tickets list. Navigate to Site Settings -> Site Administration -> Crow Canyon List View -> Configure a list view as shown below: 2. Click ‘New View’ button -> Select the ‘View Source’ as ‘Query’ and configure the other settings as shown below: 3. Conditions added in ‘Query Settings’: Conditions: ‘Status’ equal ‘Assigned’ Below conditions are specified with ‘OR’ operator in a group: ‘Assigned Staff’ equal ‘{Me}’ ‘Assigned Team’ equal ‘{CurrentUserMemberOf}’ List view is filtered to display items that are assigned either to the logged-in user or to the team/group the user belongs to, based on the value in ‘Assigned Staff’ column and ‘Assigned Team’ column respectively. 4. Click ‘Ok’ to save the view -> Click ‘Save Settings’ to save the list view configurations. 5. Refer to this article and add the above list view on a site page. Sample output Crow Canyon List view shows tickets that are assigned directly to the logged-in user and those assigned to groups they belong to. Joe Bloggs is the logged-in user in this example and he is a member of ‘IT team’ SharePoint Group.   2. Additional Service Area (Contact Crow Canyon Sales) To have an additional service area exclusively for a department/ for certain users, then it would be better to have an additional service area. This would require additional license cost. Please contact sales@crowcanyon.com for more details. Case 2: If one department people are not allowed to see other department tickets (security is major factor) Additional Service Area Please contact Sales@crowcanyon.com to proceed with the additional service area installation Item level permissions We can use our “Manage Permissions” action of our Crow Canyon NITRO Workflows and configure item level permissions based on the value of a column “Department” and grant unique permissions on item create and item update events. Please refer https://www.crowcanyon.help/article/402/ for more details regarding this configuration. Please refer https://www.crowcanyon.info/nitro/appmanual_v2/index.html?manage-permissions.html for the complete user manual for “Manage Permissions” action in Crow Canyon NITRO Workflow Manager.

Cause This issue can happen if the site URL is changed or the user is using a different host named URL to access the site other than the installed URL. Resolution Please go to each list in the site for which NITRO Forms are configured, go to NITRO Forms –> edit each lookup setting, associated item settings, auto fill user information setting and save the settings once. Repeat this process for New, Edit and display forms and publish the forms. After making the above changes in the NITRO Form settings, click on Reset cache in the form settings and publish the settings. After publishing the forms, please clear the browser cache and the forms will work as intended now. Date/Time format is not in correct format To modify the date time format, go to any list -> List Settings -> Crow Canyon NITRO Forms -> Switch to “Global Settings” tab and modify the Regional Time Settings as required. Note: This change will be applied to all the lists in that site. Attachments are not added to the item Attachments are not added to the item for SharePoint On-Premises (2013 & 2016) and below messages are shown: 1. “Please contact Your administrator to get CCSItemAttachments folder created in Site Assets and grant permissions to upload files.” 2. User is not having the Edit Permission on CCSItemAttachments Folder Cause This issue can happen if: #1. “CCSItemAttachments” folder does not exist in the ‘Site Assets’ document library #2. Or user does not have “Contribute” permission on CCSItemAttachments folder Fix #1. Activate (deactivate and activate again) “Crow Canyon Forms Attachments” feature in the site. For this, go to Site Settings -> Manage Site Features and activate Crow Canyon Forms Attachments feature #2. Grant “Contribute” permission on CCSItemAttachments folder for the required users. For this, go to Site Contents -> Site Assets document library -> CCSItemAttachments folder -> ECB menu -> “Shared With” -> Advanced and grant “Contribute” permission level for the user Item create/update fails with duplicate values error Item create/update fails due to duplicate values error as shown below Error details: “the list item could not be added or updated because duplicate values were found in the following fields (s)” in the list: Cause This issue can happen if “Enforce unique values” setting is enabled for the column shown in the error screenshot. Fix 1. Disable the “Enforce unique values” setting for the column. Go to List -> List Settings -> Edit column and disable the “Enforce unique values” setting and save. 2. If “Enforce unique values” is the business requirement then we need to specify a unique value for the column for every item while creating/updating items Form looks congested with associated items grid This can happen if associated items list view has many columns and one or more columns have multi-line data. With more columns, scroll bar comes up as shown below Please use one or more of the below options for this situation: Increase the Form width in the NITRO Form settings Navigate to required list –> list settings –> Crow Canyon NITRO Forms –> Layouts and Theme in left hand side panel –> adjust the Form Width of the NITRO form and publish the settings. Note: We need to configure form width for each form (new/edit/display) as required if separate forms are being used Modify the columns in associated item list view: Associated Items grid shows the columns as per the configurations in the list view specified in the associated item column settings. We can modify the view to remove columns that may not be required to show in the grid. Navigate to NITRO Forms configured for the list –> Advanced Section in left hand side panel –> Associated Item Settings –> Edit the required associated item settings to get the view name. See sample screenshot below: Now navigate to the associated list –> List view as mentioned in the above screenshot –> edit the view and remove the columns that are not required Remove multi-line text columns Typically, description kind of columns have multiple lines of data and that doesn’t look very good in the grid as it increases the height of grid rows as per the data in multiple lines of text columns.

How to Configure Additional level approval process in Contract Management application? 1807 views 2 min , 21 sec read 0 Applies to: SharePoint Online Description Crow Canyon standard Contracts application has two levels of approval process by default. This article describes the steps to configure third level approval process in Contract Management application. We can add any number of additional level by repeating the steps in this article. Summary of Steps Prepare the required list schema Configure Custom Actions Configure Workflow Manager workflows Detailed Instructions Prepare the List Schema Contract Renewal Options list Create below columns Column Name Column Display Name Column Type ThirdLevelAmount Third Level Amount Currency ThirdLevelApprover Third Level Approver Person or group After creating these columns, add them to NITRO forms Go to the Contract Renewal Options List Settings -> Crow Canyon NITRO forms and add the columns to the tab and publish the form. Contracts list There is an existing choice column “Approval Level” with two possible values “Level 1” and “Level 2”. Edit this column and add new option “Level 3”. Approver Tasks list There is an existing choice column “Approval Level” with two possible values “Level 1” and “Level 2”. Edit this column and add new option “Level 3”. Configure Custom Actions Once the approval process is initiated for a contract, if the contract requires approval then it starts creating the tasks in “Approver Task” list. Approver receives notification with link to their task and the task list has custom action to take the required decision. This logic is implemented using Crow Canyon Custom Actions for two levels of approval. We need to modify these custom actions configurations in Contracts list and Approver Task list to add another level of approval. Contracts list Go to Contracts list settings -> Crow Canyon Custom Actions -> Edit “Update Contract Renewal” custom action and modify the actions as shown below Action: Update Contract Renewal action Add new group to condition builder for Level 2 as shown in below screenshot. No changes are required to the column mappings. Action: Create Third level Approval Task Create a new action of type “Add List Item” to create third level approval task as shown in below screenshots. This action is to create third level approval task based on the contract value when Level 2 approver approves the contract. Approver Tasks list Go to Approval Task list settings -> Crow Canyon Custom Actions -> Edit “Approve” custom action and add new action of type “Update List Item” action as shown below. This action sets the Approval Level of the Contract to Level 3 when the Level 2 approver approves the contract. Configure Workflow Manager Workflows Crow Canyon Contracts Management approval process is implemented using the NITRO Custom Actions. However, there is a Crow Canyon NITRO Workflow that is configured to support “Approve/Deny” via email functionality. If we are not using the approve/deny via email feature, we can ignore this section. Otherwise, please follow the below instructions to support third level approval. Please go to Application Administration -> Crow Canyon NITRO Applications -> Crow Canyon NITRO Workflows -> Edit “Approval Task approve/deny via email” workflow and modify the actions like shown below Action: Update Contract renewal Modify the workflow conditions like shown below. No changes are required to column mappings. Action: Create Third Level Approval Task Create a new action of type “Add Item” in the same “Approval Task approve/deny via email“ workflow.

How to renew the contract without approval process? In standard Contracts application, if “Allow Auto Renewal” is enabled, then the contract will be auto renewed automatically without needing approval. If “Allow Auto Renewal” is disabled on a contract then it needs to go through the approval process based on the Contract Value (Cost) and the selected Renewal option. “Renewal Option” column on the Contract is a lookup column pointing to the “Contract Renewal Options” list (utility). This utility list has renewal time span along with two different levels of approvals with associated threshold values. If we would like to manually renew the Contracts without needing any approval, we can turn of the approval process for the selected renewal option in the utility. Please go to “Contract Renewal Options” list -> Edit the required item in this utility, and clear the values from “First Level Amount”, “First Level Approver”, “Second Level Amount” and “Second Level Approver” columns so that whenever someone initiates the renewal from the contract form using “Submit for Renewal” action button, it updates the Start Date and Expiration Date columns on the contract without needing any approval.

Description Crow Canyon DataSync Service for SharePoint is a Windows Service that synchronizes any ODBC-compliant database table(s) data to corresponding SharePoint list(s) and vice versa. We can use this as one way sync as well based on the use case. This service is installed in the customer’s intranet and is configurable in terms of which records to sync, mapping from database to SharePoint list columns (vice versa) and the sync frequency. It can sync new records by creating new list items in SharePoint/Database and sync existing records by updating list items. Data Sync Process: Initial Sync Initial sync is only one-way sync i.e. database to SharePoint Service will read data from the database and create/update items in SharePoint based on the unique key configured during the setup Incremental Sync Incremental sync is two-way sync SharePoint to database sync has the first preference Service will fetch items created/modified in SharePoint since last sync, and will create/update items in database Service will fetch items created/modified in database since last sync, and will add/update SharePoint list items Note: Service does not delete items in either SharePoint or database. Sample Use Cases: One Way Sync: For example, there are Network inventory tools like SCCM and LAN Sweeper that store computer and other network component information in database tables. This information is required in SharePoint for many applications that use Asset records for request tracking, reporting etc. Using this service, this data can be easily brought into SharePoint and then automatically updated whenever any change is made in corresponding database record by the network inventory tool. Data from more than one table can be brought into the same list and items can also be created in a SharePoint list manually without affecting the items coming from the database(s). Two Way Sync: For example, there is a large list in SharePoint and we would like to create Reports on this large list. SharePoint API has list view threshold limitation that it can fetch 5000 items only at a time. Using this service, we can sync any changes from SharePoint to a database table and then use Power BI etc. tools to build required reports. This article describes the installation and configuration of Crow Canyon DataSync Service. Pre-requisites An SQL Account that has read permissions on the SQL database to connect to SQL Server and execute permissions on the stored procedure that we may create during the configurations so the service can communicate with SQL database and read the required information. This information will be used in the configurations. If we need SharePoint to Database sync, SQL Account require write permissions on the target database table. A SharePoint account that has at least add/edit item permissions on the required SharePoint site. This information will be used in the configurations so the service can communicate with the SharePoint site. An SQL Admin Account to create Stored Procedure(s) in the SQL database. This account will be used only to create the stored procedure during the installation time and it will not be used in any configurations. Database and SharePoint should be accessible from the server where the service is being installed. Microsoft .NET Framework 4.7.2 or above should be installed on the server. Local Administrator account on the server to install the service. Installation Package Configuration.xml (SCCM/Lansweeper) StoredProcedure.txt CrowCanyon.DBSyncService.exe InstallUtil.exe Dependency Dlls (Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.dll, Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.Runtime.dll, Microsoft.Identity.Client.dll, microsoft.identitymodel.dll, Microsoft.IdentityModel.Extensions.dll) List Templates (O365/On-Premises) Installation Steps There are multiple steps that need to be performed to get the Crow Canyon DataSync Service installed and running.

Users can then use standard reporting tools of their choice (e.g. Crystal Reports, SQL Server Reporting Services, etc.) to run comprehensive reports on the exported SharePoint list data. Most importantly, the DataSync Tool provides access to the Version History of SharePoint list items for audit and historical reports. Audit information includes details such as what SharePoint items were changed, which fields were modified, what the old and new values are, who made the change, and when it was made. For SharePoint on-premises environment: The tool is deployed to the SharePoint application server. For SharePoint Online environment: Tool is deployed in one of the on-premises servers that has access to internet and can communicate with both SQL database and SharePoint online site. Through a few simple steps, users can quickly configure data synchronization from a SharePoint list to an external database. The tool provides support to configure any number of SharePoint lists. Users can start and stop the sync at any time for one or more lists. Users can specify the length of time between data syncs as per their reporting requirements.

How to manage external user Information in Crow Canyon helpdesk application? 1125 views 2 min , 48 sec read 0 Applies to: SharePoint Online and On-Premises Description Crow Canyon Help Desk product has a feature to auto-populate requester user information in the Ticket (e.g. Requester Email, Requester Phone, Requester Department etc. and more such attributes can be added easily for auto-population). Also, Requester field is auto-populated with logged in user when user opens the new Ticket form. This information can be pulled from SharePoint user profile, SharePoint user information list or a custom list with information about users. Please refer this article more details on this. Above feature works for users who have a SharePoint login. If you have external users submitting Tickets via Email, then user won’t be resolved in Requester field and this standard auto-population won’t work. In this case, you can use Crow Canyon NITRO Workflow solution to manage external user information in a list and use it to populate information in the Ticket. When user sends mail for the first time, a record is created just with the email and admin is notified to enter other information like Phone etc. After this for subsequent Tickets submitted by same user, this information will be auto-populated on the Ticket. This article describes steps to maintain external user information and auto-populate it in Tickets. Summary of Steps Configure List Schema Maintain external users information in a custom list Create required fields in Tickets list and add the columns to tabs Configure workflow to update the external user information in the ticket Action 1: Configure Query list action to check if the external user is already present in the custom list Action 2: Configure update item action to update the external user information in the ticket if the user information is available in the external users list Action 3: Configure create item action to create the external user record in the custom list for new users Configure workflow to send mail to admin group when a new external user is entered in the custom list Detailed Instructions Configure List Schema 1. Create a custom list (i.e External Users) and maintain all your external users in this list. Create below fields in External Users list Email Internal Name: Email Display Name: Email Column Type: Single line of Text Phone Internal Name: Phone Display Name: Phone Column Type: Single line of Text Department Internal Name: Department Display Name: Department Column Type: Single line of Text Note: We can add more columns as per the requirement and then these additional columns can be mapped to populate data in the Tickets list 2. Create external user related columns in the Tickets list Additional Requester Phone Internal Name: AdditionalRequesterPhone Display Name: Additional Requester Phone Column Type: Single line of Text Additional Requester Department Internal Name: AdditionalRequesterDepartment Display Name: Additional Requester Department Column Type: Single line of Text 3. After creating the fields, add them to NITRO forms Go to Tickets list -> List Settings -> Crow Canyon NITRO Forms -> Click Edit and Display forms -> add the additional requester columns to forms Please refer NITRO Forms section from https://www.crowcanyon.info/nitro/appmanual_v2/ this article for more details. Configure workflow to update the external user information in the ticket Configure workflow on item update event on Tickets list as shown below. The objective of this workflow is to verify if external user record already exists in the custom list and update the external user information in the Ticket if that’s the case.

How to include all Work Log Comments in Notification on Ticket close mails? 3171 views 2 min , 4 sec read 1 Applies To: SharePoint Online Description: In Crow Canyon IT/Facilities/Requests applications, there is a column “Work Log” which is version enabled so all the comments are stored in its own version along with user and time stamp. Out of the box Crow Canyon application’s product app could include only the latest comment entered into this “Work Log” during the ticket close event. This article describes possible work around to include all Work Log versions along with the known limitations. We are capturing two different types of information in “Work Log” column: User entered comments i.e. someone add comments in “Work Log” column either from portal or back end ticket form System updates the “Work Log” if someone sends an email to SharePoint if ticket’s case id syntax present in the mail subject We can configure such that all comments entered by user (#1 above) are included in the notifications by following the steps described in this article but we cannot include system updates (#2 above) with configurations. Summary of Steps: Create new column “hiddenWorkLog” of type “Multiple lines of text (Enhanced Rich)” in Tickets list. Configure back end Tickets list New and Edit forms with submit action Configure Portal Ticket Edit form with submit action Configure mail templates Notification on Ticket Completion utility Detailed Steps: 1. Create new column “hiddenWorkLog” of type “Multiple lines of text (Enhanced Rich)” in Tickets list Go to Tickets list settings, create new column with the name and type mentioned above. This column will be used to copy the Work Log entries every time when someone add comments to “Work Log” column. This column won’t be shown on the form but it will be used in the mail templates. 2. Configure back end Tickets list New and Edit forms with submit action Go to Tickets list, list settings, Crow Canyon NITRO Forms, configure the following Check “Hide Save Button” checkbox under “Layouts and Theme” section. Set the “Bottom Action Panel Button Align” value to “Right” under “Layouts and Theme” section. Add “Submit Action”. Drag and drop Submit action from “Actions” section into the form beside the “Cancel” button. (See Screenshot 1 below) Select the newly created “Submit Action”, Set “Button Title” to “Save”, set the desired icon and paste the below whole script into the “Script Function” text box in “Action Settings” section on the right side of the designer surface and click “Apply”. Publish the form. (See Screenshot 2 below) Repeat above four steps in “Edit Tickets Form” as well. Script: var fn_prepareComment = function (currUserName, comment) { return \"<div style='margin-bottom: 20px;'><div><strong>\" + currUserName + \"</strong> (\" + (new Date()).toLocaleString() + \")</div><div>\" + comment + \"</div></div>\"; } try { var resultObject = null; var hiddenWorkLogColumnName = \"hiddenWorkLog\"; var workLogColumnName = \"WorkLog\"; var ccsFormUtils = window.ccs_g_FormUI; var workLogColumnVal = ccsFormUtils.fetchColumnValueUI(workLogColumnName); if (workLogColumnVal) { resultObject = {}; resultObject[hiddenWorkLogColumnName] = fn_prepareComment(ccsFormUtils.getCurrentUserName(), workLogColumnVal); if (ccsFormUtils.isEditForm) { resultObject[hiddenWorkLogColumnName] += ccsFormUtils.listItem.get_item(hiddenWorkLogColumnName) || \"\"; } } functionCallback(false, resultObject); } catch (ex) { functionCallback(false, null); } Screenshot 1 (How to add Submit action?): Screenshot 2 (How to insert the script in Submit Action button?): 3. Configure Portal Ticket Edit form with submit action Go to Portal site, Portal Settings, Edit the Tickets list form under “Portal Forms” section, and repeat the steps described in the #2 above. Since Portal tickets list form does not contain the “Work Log” column in the new form, these configurations are required only in edit form. 4. Configure mail templates Notification on Ticket Completion utility Go to Application Administration, Notifications, click on “Notification on Ticket Completion” tile, replace “<<Work Log>>” column place holder with “ <<hiddenWorkLog>> ” in “User Mail Body” and “Staff Mail Body” columns and save the item.

Symptom: “Send Email” function does not send the email with report to the selected recipients. Also, no error message is shown in the UI. Cause: Workflows are not configured on ‘CrowCanyonAppsEmails’ list Details: “ Send Email” functionality does not directly send email to the recipients. It creates an item in CrowCanyonAppsEmails list with the required content and report attachment. Crow Canyon Workflows then sends an email based on the report content/image in the list item. Note: Please make sure that users who will be using this report email functionality have at least “Contribute without delete” permissions on CrowCanyonAppsEmails list. This list is created along with NITRO activation and you can find a link to it in the “Site Contents” page Fix : Configure workflows on “CrowCanyonAppsEmails” list to send mails to recipients. Refer workflows configuration instructions from: https://www.crowcanyon.help/article/225 (In the sample article workflows are configured on “Send Mails” list, please follow the same steps and instead of “Send Mails” list use the “CrowCanyonAppsEmails” list for configuring the mail template and workflows). Note: For reports, mail is sent with “From” address of the current user. That is mail sender is the logged in user who does the action from UI. Please also refer related article about configuring outgoing emails in workflow manager. 2. Symptom: Below error message is displayed while previewing the NITRO Report in Report Manager or viewing the same report on a site page: Cause: One of the columns used in NITRO Report configuration has been deleted from the SharePoint list. Resolution: Recreate the column with same column internal name and type. Steps: Check for the column that is used in the report configuration and is deleted from the SharePoint list. In this example, ‘Number Of Units’ column has been deleted from the SharePoint list. Refer to this article to know about internal name of a list column. Column display name Number Of Units Column internal name NumberOfUnits Column type Single line of text On deletion of this column, the ‘Column’ field under ‘Row (y-axis)’ section becomes blank in the NITRO Report settings page as shown below: 2. To resolve this issue, create a column with same internal name (‘NumberOfUnits’) and same column type in the list. 3. Navigate to the NITRO Report and refresh the page. The ‘Number Of Units’ column will be available under ‘Row (y-axis)’ section as shown below: Click ‘Show Report Preview’ to preview the NITRO Report. Also, refresh the site page where the above NITRO Report is added to view the report. Note : If the column is re-created with a different internal name, then it is required to select the new column manually in NITRO Report settings à ‘Save’ the report à Reset cache from the ‘NITRO Configurations’ page. 3. Symptom: Report on a site page shows an error message (as shown below) but preview for the same report in report settings page works correctly. Cause: After recreating the deleted column or after modifying settings for the column used in NITRO Reports, the NITRO cache is not cleared. Resolution: Reset cache from the ‘NITRO Configurations’ page. Navigate to Site Settings -> Site Administration -> Crow Canyon NITRO Site Settings -> Expand ‘Cache Site Metadata’ section -> Click ‘Reset Cache’ as shown below -> Refresh the site page to view the NITRO Report.

Please refer this article for other general performance configurations in Crow Canyon applications: https://www.crowcanyon.help/article/243/ First technique described uses the caching of infrequently modified data to improve the form load time. Second technique is for lookup column load time issues. It is not uncommon to have lookup lists with a lot of items and there is no easy way in standard SharePoint forms to deal with the resultant slow loading of forms. NITRO forms has addressed this problem while enhancing the user experience of usage of lookup columns.   Enable Cache for site NITRO forms can cache the list metadata (column information, form settings etc.) instead of loading it every time. This helps improve performance significantly as this cache avoids fetching this data repeatedly and this data doesn’t get modified often. Form designers/administrators can reset the cache if any change is made to the list columns or form settings, this will automatically refresh the cache data for all users. Also, users can clear the browser cache to get the updated settings immediately. This settings applies to all the lists in the site. To enable caching, please navigate to any list that has NITRO Forms –> list settings –> Crow Canyon NITRO Forms –> Form Settings in the top ribbon –> Enable Cache. See sample screenshot below We can also enable caching from site settings –> Site Administration –> Crow Canyon NITRO site settings –> enable Cache Site Metadata Enable delay in loading the lookup columns data Lookup columns present in the list forms need to load all the values from respective lists and display them in the New/Edit forms. In case of having more lookup items in a lookup list, form loading takes time to load as it need to fetch all the records present in the lookup list. With lookup lists having thousands of items, it slows down the form loading time significantly. In our NITRO forms, instead of loading lookup items on the form load, we have the ability to delay it until user clicks on lookup column drop down control. Thus initial form can be loaded much faster and lookup list can be loaded on demand. This feature can be applied from NITRO Form settings configured for the list. Please navigate to the list –> NITRO Forms configured for the list –> Advanced section in left hand side panel –> Lookup Settings –> create lookup setting –> select the lookup column –> enable delay load(See screenshot below) Enable Search feature for lookup column to address list view threshold in lookup list: There may be cases where lookup list has lot of items and it is difficult to find the item in drop down. This feature works even in cases where lookup list exceeds the list view threshold. In standard forms, in threshold scenarios, lookup column doesn’t render on the form and user can’t select the lookup column value on the form. To address this, NITRO Form has a search feature for lookup columns, that uses the SharePoint search to find items and user can then select the items in search results to set the value in lookup column.

This article describes the alternative solutions. Alternative Solutions: Option 1: Create a web part page (workspace). Add a list view web part to the page. Configure the view filter conditions for the list view web part to show only the items you’d like to show. Add the link to the Quick launch. Configure permissions for this workspace page to limit who can access the page. Follow these instructions to create and configure a list view web part in a page: https://www.crowcanyon.help/article/264/ To configure permissions for a workspace page, go to the document library where the workspace page is created -> select the workspace page -> click “Advanced” in ECB -> click “Shared With”-> Advanced -> click “Stop Inheriting Permissions” and Grant unique permissions to required groups. Note: Users will still have access to list items and can navigate to other views from the default list page (i.e. Site Contents -> List) or by direct URL/ search. Sample Screenshot: Option 2: Use SharePoint Designer to create a filtered list view. Use this if you would like to filter tickets based on a SharePoint Group. Create one SharePoint group per department (or any other criteria you need to use, e.g. location, Manager, etc). Use the “Assigned Team” column in the ticket to specify which group should see that ticket/request/work order. Configure the view filter using SharePoint designer. Please refer sample list view configuration using SharePoint designer from: https://www.crowcanyon.help/article/304/ Once configured the view shows the tickets only if the logged in user is a member of the SharePoint Group that is assigned to the ticket. Note: Users will still have access to list items and can navigate to other views from the default list page (i.e. Site Contents -> List) or by direct URL/ search. Option 3: If you would like to implement strict security controls, you can configure item level permissions using Crow Canyon NITRO Workflow manager. Please refer sample article to configure item level permissions using Crow Canyon NITRO workflows from: https://www.crowcanyon.help/article/402 .

Workflows configured on list are not working Workflows configured on a list are not working for specific users Workflow Manager page doesn’t show any configured workflows Infinite loop of execution Columns are not shown in Condition builder control in Workflow Manager 1. Workflows configured on list are not working Issue Workflows configured on a specific list are not working for any user whereas for other lists workflows are working fine Cause This may happen if events are not getting fired for a particular list. This can be the case if event receivers registered for this list are corrupted. We can validate this by enabling the information logs for Crow Canyon Workflow Manager solution. Please refer #6 from this article to enable logs. If the logs are not being generated (even after enabling the information logs and ensuring that everyone has required permissions on log folder as described in above article) then it is likely that events are not getting fired. You can confirm this by triggering workflows on other lists where workflows are working and checking that logs are getting generated. Resolution Using SharePoint Manager, navigate to the list that has the issue -> expand “Event Receivers” node -> Remove all the event receivers registered on the list. We have to reactivate the corresponding feature for every event receiver that is being deleted, sample event receiver names and corresponding feature names are listed below Event Receiver Feature Process to Recreate WorkflowManagerEventReceiverItemAdded WorkflowManagerEventReceiverItemDeleted WorkflowManagerEventReceiverItemDeleting WorkflowManagerEventReceiverItemUpdated WorkflowManagerEventReceiverItemUpdating Crow Canyon Workflow Manager Feature: CrowCanyonWorkflowManager Deactivate Crow Canyon Workflow Manager feature and activate Workflow Manager feature for the Site Collection. Note: Feature deactivation / activation need to be done using command prompt for Workflow Manager. Refer instructions from this article CCSSREventReceiverItemAdded CCSSREventReceiverItemAdding CCSSREventReceiverItemUpdated CCSSREventReceiverItemUpdating Crow Canyon Product Workflows Feature: CCSSREventReceiver_Feature1 Deactivate and Activate “CCS SR Event Receiver V3.6” feature for the site. Refer instructions from this article . With the above steps, new event receivers get attached to the list and the workflows should work as intended. Workflows configured on a list are not working for specific users 2. Workflows configured on a list are not working for specific users Issue Workflows configured on a list are not working for specific user(s). Workflows may be working for users with higher privileges like Site Collection administrators. Cause Crow Canyon Workflow configuration settings are stored in a hidden list in root site of the site collection. Event based Workflows like Item Added, Updated, and Deleted will run in user context and if the user doesn’t have required permissions on the root site, workflow execution will fail as it will not be able to read the settings from the root site. Resolution Go to root site -> Site Settings -> Users and Permissions -> Site Permissions -> Grant “Read” permission on the root site for Everyone. 3. Workflow Manager page doesn’t show any configured workflows Issue 1: Workflow Manager page doesn’t show any configured workflows and keeps showing the loading image as shown below: Cause This can happen if large number of workflows are configured in a site. Workflow Manager Configurations are stored in JSON format and if there are large number of workflows then the JSON length will be larger and it fails to get the data. Resolution Please refer https://www.crowcanyon.help/article/283/ that has steps to increase the MaxJsonLength property for SharePoint Web Application. After the above step, please do IISRESET in all the SharePoint servers. Issue 2: ‘NITRO Workflows’ settings page is not loading Cause This issue can happen if the application pool account doesn’t have permissions on SharePoint configuration or web application content database. Resolution Grant permissions for the application pool account on SharePoint configurations and web application content database. Please refer this article to grant permissions on configuration database and content databases. 4. Infinite loop of execution Issue Workflows are triggered by actions of other workflows in an infinite loop Cause 1 This could happen if a workflow is configured to update the same item without any conditions.

Description Archival is the process of moving old or inactive list items from the ‘main / live’ list to the corresponding archive list. The archive list has similar columns as the main list and archiving is done to reduce the number of items in the main list to improve list performance. SharePoint has a limit on number of items (list view threshold of 5000 items) that can be processed in any operation so archiving helps keep the item count within the limits. Please note that there are other ways to address list view threshold and you can find more details here . This article describes the steps to configure simple archival functionality on a list without archiving associated lists. This article takes the example of Tickets list. Please note that list items that are moved to archived list are permanently deleted from the main list. Note: If you need to move list items (Tickets) along with all associated lists (like Tasks and Emails) to different lists without breaking the relation then please refer this article . Summary of Steps Configure List Schema Configure Workflow using NITRO Workflows Detailed Instructions 1. Configure List Schema Take list template of Tickets list Go to Site Contents -> Tickets list -> List Settings -> Click on ‘Save list as Template’ link Give the File Name, Template Name and click on “Ok” Create Archived Tickets list using this list template. Go to Site Contents -> Add an app -> Select Tickets list template -> name it as Archived Tickets list. After creating the Archived Tickets list, recreate all the lookup fields (e.g. Category, Issue Type etc…) in Archived Tickets list. 2. Configure Workflow using NITRO Workflows Configure a scheduled workflow on Tickets list using NITRO Workflows. This workflow will run everyday to move inactive items from the main list to the archive list. You can choose the hour such that it runs during non-business hours. Go to Application Administration -> Crow Canyon NITRO Apps -> NITRO Workflows and configure a scheduled query workflow as shown below: CAML Query used above: This query will fetch all Tickets where closed date column value is less than 365 days from Today. That is, these Tickets have been closed for more than a year. This can be modified to change this time period and also more conditions can be added to only archive those items that are not actively needed in the Tickets list (for e.g., you may choose to not archive Tickets of a particular Category) <View> <Query> <Where> <Leq> <FieldRef Name ='ClosedDate' /> <Value Type='DateTime' > <Today OffsetDays='-365' /> </Value> </Leq> </Where> </Query> </View> Move Item Action: Configure move item action as shown below.

SPFx is a web part model that provides full support for client-side and responsive SharePoint development. Crow Canyon NITRO platform has full support for Modern UI and you can build rich application using this framework. If Modern UI sites are shared with external users, Crow Canyon SPFx web parts may show this error message: “Sorry something went wrong”. To fix this, grant read permissions for external users on “ClientSideAssets” document library in the App Catalog site for the tenant as described below. Detailed Steps 1. Go to SharePoint App Catalog site for the tenant 2. Go to ‘ClientSideAssets’ document library (URL will be like: https:// <your domain> .sharepoint.com/sites/ <your app catalog name> /ClientSideAssets/AllItems.aspx) of the App Catalog site. To get this URL, navigate to the SharePoint Admin Center from your M365 admin site. Click on ‘More Features’, then click on “Open” under “Apps” section. From there, replace the part of the URL after “apps” or “appcatalog” in the URL, i.e. the part that starts with “_layouts/..”, with “/ClientSideAssets/AllItems.aspx”. 3. Go to Library Settings -> ‘Permissions for this document library’ and grant read permissions for the external users on this library (i.e. add all individual external users to ‘Site Visitors’ group) If we would like to grant permissions to all users including all external users at once, we can do this using SharePoint Online Management Shell by following below steps. Steps: Open SharePoint Management Online Shell and run below command. It prompts for SharePoint Online tenant URL, enter URL (for example, https://yourtenant-admin.sharepoint.com) and then it prompts for credentials. Enter SharePoint Admin or Global Admin credentials to connect to your tenant. Connect-SPOService Once the connection is done, run below command Set-SPOTenant -ShowAllUsersClaim $true Now, SharePoint allows resolving a new group named “All Users (membership)”. Grant “Read” permissions to this group on “Client Side Assets” library in App Catalog site as shown below. If we do not want to allow resolving this group in sites any longer, after performing above steps, run below command in SharePoint Online Management Shell to disable this group. Set-SPOTenant -ShowAllUsersClaim $false Note : If granting ‘Read’ permissions to “All Users (membership)” group does not work (i.e., if external users are still seeing errors in SPFx web parts), then grant ‘Read’ permissions to “All Users” group as well. If this still does not work, grant read permissions to each external user manually on this library. Note: To grant the permissions to external users on this library, it is required that external user access is enabled on the App catalog site collection. To enable external sharing for app catalog site, please ensure that external sharing is enabled in SharePoint Admin Center. Refer instructions from this article . Once this is done follow below step to enable external sharing for App catalog site. Go to Admin Centers, select SharePoint, expand sites, click “Active Sites” in left panel. Select the App Catalog site collection and click “Sharing” and select “New and existing guests” option and save the settings (see screenshot below). For more details, refer this article . "

If you are also using Crow Canyon Contracts Application, then these two can be integrated so that Contract has the reference to the Purchase Order. Contracts purchased via the Purchasing application can be created in the Contracts application and statistics and status can be automatically updated in the Purchase Order. Integration features are listed below: Contracts have reference to the Purchase Order via which payment has been made for the Contract. And Purchase Order can show all the related Contracts New Contract Form can be invoked from the Purchase Item to create the purchased Contract. This action will be available only when the purchase category is “Contract” type After Contract is created, automatically increment the “Received Quantity” on the purchase item Automatically set purchase item status as “Partially Received” or “Received” depending on the purchase quantity and the received quantity Similarly, automatically set the Purchase order status as “Partially Fulfilled” (when some but not all Contracts are created) or “Fulfilled” (when all purchased Contracts are created) This article describes the configurations required for this integration. Prerequisites Crow Canyon standard Purchasing and Contract Management applications Summary of Steps Configure the required schema Create a lookup in Contracts list to the Purchase Order. This will be a cross-site lookup column (“Related Purchase Order”) Add “Contract” category in the Purchase Categories list Configure “Create Contract” Custom action in “Purchase Items” list Action 1: “Add Item” action to create Contract Action 2: “Update Item” action that increases the “Received Quantity” on Contract creation Action 3: Invoke “Partially Fulfill PO” custom action on Purchase Order Action 4: Invoke “Fulfill PO” custom action on Purchase Order Update “Update Received Quantity” custom action in Purchase Items Standard application has custom action “Update Received Quantity” that updates the received quantity in Purchase items. Update this custom action to show for all the purchase categories except “Contract” category since it will have its separate custom action “Create Contract” (#2 point above) Detailed Steps 1. Configure the required schema 1.a. Create “Related Purchase Order” cross-site lookup column in the Contracts list Go to Contract Management site –> Application Administration –> Crow Canyon Nitro Apps –> Crow Canyon NITRO Studio –> Advanced Lookup –> Create “Related Purchase Order” cross-site lookup as shown below: 1.b. Add “Contract” item in the Purchase Categories list Go to Application Administration –> Purchase Categories –> Create a new item for “Contract” type category 2. Configure “Create Contract” custom action in “Purchase Items” list Go to Purchase Order site, go to “Application Administration”, click “Configure Purchase Items” under Configure Lists section. Click on “Crow Canyon Custom Actions” and configure the actions as shown below: Action 1: “Add Item” action to create Contract Add new action of type “Add item” as shown below: Predefined column values Action 2: “Update Item” action that increments the “Received Quantity” on Contract creation Add new action of type “Update item” as shown below. Value Expression used below: $add([Received Quantity|ReceivedQuantity],1)     Action 3: Invoke “Partially Fulfill PO” custom action on Purchase Order “Partially Fulfill PO” custom action is part of standard application and here we just need to invoke it on the Purchase Order item. This custom action checks and sets the status of the Purchase Order as “Partially Fulfilled” if not all ordered items are received yet. Action 4: Invoke “Fulfill PO” custom action on Purchase Order “Fulfill PO” custom action is part of standard application and here we just need to invoke it on the Purchase Order item. This custom action checks and sets the status of the Purchase Order as “Fulfilled” if all ordered items have been received. 3. Update “Update Received Quantity” custom action in Purchase Items Go to Purchase Items list –> List Settings –> Crow Canyon Custom Actions –> Edit the “Update Received Quantity” custom action and add condition as shown below: Note: No other changes are required in this custom action.

For example, we have “Type of Change” and “Change Requests” lists. We have “Type of Change” lookup column in “Change Requests” list. Approver Definition configuration is as shown in below screenshot. Required Behavior: In the above case, we would like to set the “Approval Status” to “Not Required” instead of auto approving and sending mails. Solution: If there are no conditions set in the Approver definition configuration, for every item approval status sets to “Approved” if no approver is found in utility/lookup item. We can add conditions to skip the approver definition. For example, add conditions like “lookup::Approvercolumn” is not empty so approval process gets executed only those for which approvers are available in the selected lookup item. Otherwise, approval status remains at “Not Required” in the item.   Approval App NITRO Studio- Advanced Approvals Troubleshooting About supportTeam View all posts by supportTeam → Related Articles Troubleshooting steps for Crow Canyon NITRO Applications Troubleshooting Steps For Crow Canyon Data Sync Service How to address “Chrome detected unusual code on this page and blocker it to protect your personal information” error in Google Chrome browser when modifying web part pages?

Both the outgoing email by technician and incoming email from requester are captured in the system. This article helps configuring the color coding based on the technician (assigned staff), requester communication. Design: Create a new choice column “Communication Status” that has three different possible values “No Action Required, Waiting for Requester Response, Requester Responded”. By default, Communication Status value will be “No Action Required”. Whenever technician uses “Send Email” action on the ticket form to send mail, Communication Status changes to “Waiting for Requester Response”. If requester reply to the technician email, Communication Status changes to “Requester Responded”. Either technician can manually set the Communication Status to “No Action Required” or system auto set the status on ticket closure. We can configure color coding based on this communication status column using the Crow Canyon Conditional Formatting. Summary of steps: Create a choice column in Tickets list Configure Update Item Action in Advanced Email of the Tickets list Configure a workflow on Email Tickets list to update the ticket Configure conditional formatting for Choice column in Tickets list Configure Workflow on Tickets list to reset the communication status to No Action Required on ticket close Detailed Steps: Please go to Application Administration –> Configure Lists –> Configure Tickets –> Create a choice column with internal name as “CommunicationStatus” like below Configure Update Item Action in Advanced Email of the Tickets list to update Communication Status column to Waiting on Requester Response Please navigate to Application Administration –> Configure Lists –> Configure Tickets –> Crow Canyon Email Manager Settings –> Configure Update Item like below to update choice column to Outgoing whenever email is sent from ticket.

For example, in Home page when user presses the keyboard “Tab” button, control focus starts from the first actionable/clickable area i.e. site logo (#1 in the screenshot below). After that on every tab key press, focus moves as per the sequence of actionable buttons/areas (home page logo, Home, Logout, top menu links, quick links, notifications, contact us in footer). User can press enter on the focussed item to navigate to it without using the mouse. Please see screenshot below: Similarly, other portal pages like View Page, Search Page and List Form pages also follow the AODA compliance and the control focus changes as per the sequence of actionable areas.

    "text": " Crow Canyon Applications , How-To / How to enable Sentiment Analysis in Crow Canyon Applications How to enable Sentiment Analysis in Crow Canyon Applications 3637 views 3 min , 42 sec read 0 Applies To SharePoint Online Description Sentiment analysis evaluates input text to assign a sentiment score ranging from 0 (negative) to 1 (positive). This capability is useful in detecting sentiment and enables custom business process based on the sentiment. Crow Canyon uses Microsoft Azure Text Analytics API for this and you can find more information here . This capability can be enabled in Crow Canyon Help Desk Application. When a Ticket is created, application will process the text in Ticket “Description” (or “Title” if there is no description) and determine the text sentiment score (0 to 1). Also, application assigns a configurable text value based on this score for easy identification and configurations. This data can then be used in application for various purposes like decide the priority of the Ticket, configure separate SLAs for Tickets having negative sentiment and send escalation notification if sentiment is excessively negative etc. It can also be used to configure reports to see sentiment for various types of Tickets, trend for assigned staff and time range etc. Summary of Steps Following steps are required to enable Sentiment Analysis in Crow Canyon Applications: Configurations list schema Tickets list schema SLA workflow based on business needs Detailed Steps Configurations List Schema We need to create a multiple lines of text column (plain text) in configurations list with name “SentimentAnalysis”. Go to site contents –> Configurations list –> List settings –> Crow Canyon NITRO Forms –> click on “Create column” in the ribbon (see sample screenshot below) Create a new tab in the form with name “Advanced” and add the newly created “SentimentAnalysis” column to this tab in the NITRO Form. We can rename this column to “Sentiment Analysis” as needed. Please make sure this column is also added to edit and display forms. Note: Ensure that there is no space between Sentiment and Analysis during the column creation (SentimentAnalysis). After column is created, we can rename this column as needed. “Sentiment Analysis” column value contains the configuration required for evaluating the sentiment, details are given below: Sample configuration of the Sentiment Analysis is shown below: Enabled =Yes APIKey =xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx URL =southcentralus ScoreNumberColumn =SentimentScore ScoreTextColumn =SentimentValue ScoreTextValue =0.3-Angry,0.5-Negative,0.7-Neutral,1.0-Positive (i) Enabled : This column is used to check whether Sentiment analysis is enabled/disabled in our application. The only two possible values are Yes and No. Yes to enable and No to disable this feature in our application (ii) APIKey : This is a subscription key that needs to be used while calling Cognitive Service. For more details on this, please refer “How to create a Cognitive Services subscription” section at the end of this article. (iii) URL : Region specific URL prefix of Text Analytics service e.g. “westcentralus” or “southcentralus”. Please refer “How to create a Cognitive Services subscription” section at the end of this article. (iv) ScoreNumberColumn : This parameter is the internal name of the column that is used in the Tickets list. This column value range is between 0 – 1. API generates a decimal value between 0 and 1 based on the text sentiment and this result will be stored in this column on the ticket. 0 – Negative 1 – Positive (v) ScoreTextColumn : This parameter is the internal name of the column that is used in the Tickets list. This is a single line of text or choice column and will be filled by the Product app on ticket creation. It is a mapping from the numeric sentiment score value to a text value for easy reference in configurations and reports. The text can vary based on business needs. We can configure a value like “0.3- Angry,0.5-Negative,0.7-Neutral,1.0-Positive” and this would imply: If Score is <= 0.3, set the ScoreTextValue as Angry If Score is <= 0.5, set the ScoreTextValue as Negative If Score is <= 0.7, set the ScoreTextValue as Neutral If Score is <= 1.0, set the ScoreTextValue as Positive Tickets list Schema There are two columns to be created in the Tickets list: – SentimentScore – SentimentValue (i) SentimentScore : This column should be created with the same internal name that is used for “ScoreNumberColumn” for the Sentiment Analysis configuration list item. Go to site contents –> Tickets list –> list settings –> Crow Canyon NITRO Forms –> create a number column with two decimals like below Add it to the required position in the Ticket forms as needed. Value in this column will be set to the score that is obtained by the sentiment analysis functionality in the application. Note: We can rename this column once it is created with the required internal name (ii) SentimentValue : This column should be crea"

For any specific cases not covered directly by the configurations, custom JavaScript and CSS can be added. These custom scripts can be invoked on form load, on column values change and before/after item submit. For all these cases, scripts can be invoked conditionally based on values entered in the form. This article lists some of the use cases and configuration steps for custom scripts: Switch to a tab on the form when a specific value is selected in a column Include one or more custom JavaScript files in NITRO forms Show a popup message on column value change Open Portal Quick link tiles in modal dialog How can we configure a hyperlink in the “Safety Data Sheet” document library whenever a new “SDS image” is uploaded or edited? How to configure Print feature in Portal forms? Copy SharePoint column value to clipboard on button click Switch to a tab on the form when a specific value is selected in a column This example is based on following configurations on the form: A tab is added to form with name “Spam” Tab permissions are configured to show this tab only when Category column value is ‘Email’ and ‘Issue Type’ column value is Spam When user selects the ‘Issue Type’ as Spam, focus should automatically shift to this tab in the NITRO forms (that is, this tab should get selected). This can be configured using NITRO Forms advanced options. Go to List Settings -> Crow Canyon NITRO Forms -> Advanced Section -> Form Event Actions. Note: If “Form Event Actions” option is not available in the NITRO forms, please upgrade the NITRO Studio for the site to latest version. Go to site -> Application Administration -> Crow Canyon NITRO Studio -> Click “Update This Site” link. With “Form Event Actions” we can invoke script code on column change event or during form load. In this scenario, we will configure a form event action on ‘Issue Type’ column change to switch focus to “Spam” tab. Click “Form Event Actions” button and configure a new action that will be executed when user changes “Issue Type” column value to “Spam” on the form: Next, configure an “Execute Script” action to switch to specific tab: Script used above : var tabTitle = \"NAMEOFTAB\"; var selTab = $(\"#tabStripForm > div> ul > li .k-link:contains(\"+tabTitle+\")\"); if(selTab.length == 1 && selTab.text().trim() == tabTitle){ var tabIdx = $(\"#tabStripForm > div > ul > li\").index(selTab.closest(\"li\")); $(\"#tabStripForm\").data(\"kendoTabStrip\").select(tabIdx); Note: Please rename “NAMEOFTAB” with the required tab in the above script Next, save the settings and publish the NITRO Forms. You may have to refresh NITRO Form a couple of times for new settings to take effect as settings are cached to improve performance. Include one or more Custom JavaScript files in NITRO forms We can add custom JavaScript that is loaded at the time of form load. We can put the script in a file and include the link to the file in the form settings. In this example we have described the configuration to add one or more custom JavaScript files in NITRO forms. Instructions : Upload script files to ‘Site Assets’ library in the site. In this sample use case, we have uploaded custom script files to ‘Scripts’ folder in the ‘Site Assets’ library. URLs: https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/Helpdesk/IT/SiteAssets/Scripts/File1.js https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/Helpdesk/IT/SiteAssets/Scripts/File2.js 2. Configure custom JavaScript files in NITRO Forms. Go to List Settings -> Open NITRO forms -> Click on Advanced Settings -> Click on Custom JavaScript 1. Link – If we would like to add only one custom JavaScript link to the form then we can use this option. 2. Eval To include two or more Custom JavaScript links to the form follow below instructions. Note: Please note that File1.js and File2.js URLs (highlighted in above image) in the above script need to be re placed with the actual locations of the JS file(s). Script used in the above screenshot : var script1 = document.createElement('script'); script1.type = 'text/javascript'; script1.src = \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/Helpdesk/IT/SiteAssets/Scripts/File1.js\"; $('head').append(script1); var script2 = document.createElement('script'); script2.type = 'text/javascript'; script2.src = \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/Helpdesk/IT/SiteAssets/Scripts/File2.js\"; $('head').append(script2); functionCallback(); After configuring the forms, save the settings and publish the NITRO Forms. 3. How to configure Form Event actions to show a popup message?

Most common scenario is when there are two environments for an application: Development and Production. In this case forms and workflows can be configured and tested on development environment and then exported and applied to production. Any list and field changes in development environment should be applied to production before doing the export and import. General Prerequisites SharePoint list and fields schema (list names, field internal name, display name and type) should match in both source and target sites to get the export and import to work If Forms and Workflows refer to other lists (lookup column relationships), then schema should match for these related lists as well Export and Import Crow Canyon NITRO Forms Functionality and Prerequisites List and related lists in source and target site should have same schema Associated lists should have NITRO Forms with same names. This will generally be the case if lists have same names All forms configured on the list are imported/exported and NITRO form settings of target list are overwritten, so user should back them up if required (by exporting) Note: User need to save/publish the settings after import If NITRO Forms are using submit actions which invoke NITRO custom actions, then actions with same Id should be present in target Unless these sites are created by our setups, generally action Ids will be different even though they may have same name. In this case, user can update the Form settings with correct action after import Feature limitations Cross-site lookups/associated items are not supported If Script is used, and it has hard-coded site/list Id/URL etc., then this has to be updated manually in target after import Steps to Export/Import NITRO Forms Export Go to the source list settings –> Crow Canyon NITRO Forms –> click on “Manage Forms” in Form Ribbon as shown below –> click on “Advanced Settings” –> click on “Export” button, it asks to save the file locally as shown below: Note: If multiple forms are configured in the list, then it directly opens the below dialog when we open the NITRO Forms for that list. Import Go to the target list settings, Crow Canyon NITRO Forms, click on “Manage Forms”, click on “Advanced Settings”, click on “Choose File”, select the form settings exported file in above step and click “Import”. Please wait until the forms settings are imported and it shows the success message once the import is completed. Note that these settings are not applied to list forms after the import, these are just imported in the designer UI. You need to publish the forms for these settings to take effect. You can make changes after import and then publish. Export and Import Crow Canyon Workflow Manager Workflows Feature Limitations Mail templates won’t be exported/imported. Once the workflow is imported, we need to edit the “Send Mail” actions, create the required mail templates manually and update the workflow settings. Steps to Export/Import Workflow Manager Settings Export Go to Site Settings, Crow Canyon NITRO Apps, Open NITRO Workflows, use the “Export Workflow Settings” button under the “Actions” column in the grid as shown below. When we click this export button, browser prompts to save the settings (*.json”) file locally, save to the local drives. Import We can import the workflow manager settings as a new workflow. If we would like to override the existing workflows using import options, we can achieve by deleting the old workflow and create new workflow using the import option. Create new workflow, select site, list, browse the exported settings file, click “Import” button as shown below Note: Please note that we have to reconfigure the mail template settings.

    "text": " External Data Column configuration in NITRO Forms External Data Column configuration in NITRO Forms 3186 views 6 min , 31 sec read 0 Applies To SharePoint Online and SharePoint On-Premises Overview NITRO Forms allow integration of external data with SharePoint list data. Data in Microsoft SQL server tables can be fetched and populated in SharePoint list columns in the NITRO Forms. For data in sources other than SQL Server, custom service option can be used. When list item is saved, this data is saved in the SharePoint item columns. This saved data has reference to the SQL table record based on the unique Id value of record that is saved in the list item data. While fetching data from Database, we can get it based on data already present on the form. This can be based on other external columns or regular SharePoint list columns or combination of both. These cases are explained in more details in below sections. NITRO also allows insert / update of records in external data. Please refer this article for more details. Prerequisites Multiple Records If you want to pull back multiple records from SQL (e.g. to show a dropdown of choices from the SQL DB), you will need to create two Single Line of Text columns prior to setting up the below configurations. For example, you will want to create a column called “Department” and one called “DepartmentID” if you are pulling back multiple records from a table of departments. Single Record When using the Single Record option, you’re typically mapping information from SQL to columns in SharePoint based on the returned record. In this case, you’ll want to create as many SharePoint columns ( Single Line of text, Multiple lines of text, Choice, Number, Currency, Date, Yes/No, or Lookup ) as necessary to capture the information from SQL. Steps to configure External Data Columns Go to NITRO form Setting Page Go to the Form Settings section on the left panel Click on ‘External Data Columns’ Button to bring up the list of existing configurations Click ‘New Configuration’ button to bring up ‘Configure External Data Column’ form. Specify the external data settings options as per the description given below Configuration Name This should be a unique name for the external data configuration for a column in the NITRO form. Query Output Multiple Records This is used when list of items is maintained in database table and on the Form user needs to make a selection of one item. For example: Get all departments and let user select the department for a purchase request Get all employees of the department (based on selected department on the Form) and let user select the employee who will be approving the purchase request This configuration uses two list columns, one for the display and selection of the database record, and other for storing the unique value of the database record Single Records This is used when a single record is fetched from database and one or more values from the record need to be mapped to corresponding SharePoint list column. Typically this record will be fetched based on the data already on the form. For example: Based on the selected employee on the form, fetch the employee’s email and phone number and populate these values on the corresponding columns on the Form In this case multiple attributes fetched from the database record can be mapped to corresponding columns on the form. Supported SharePoint list column types are Single Line of text, Multiple lines of text, Choice, Number, Currency, Date, Yes/No and Lookup Web Service Type NITRO Forms are implemented fully in client side code (JavaScript and CSS). However, database can’t be connected directly from client side code and so an intermediate service is required to connect and fetch data. Below options are available for this service: Default SharePoint On-Premises: NITRO Forms has SharePoint server-side code component that directly connects to Database. This means database server should be accessible from the SharePoint server(s) SharePoint Online: Crow Canyon has a web service running in Microsoft Azure to connect to your database and fetch data. This means database server should be accessible from Microsoft Azure network Custom If we don’t want to use the default Crow Canyon provided services, you can easily write your own service and deploy it. In this case the database connection string need not be specified in the NITRO Forms settings and can be there only in your service code Please refer Custom Service section in this document for more details. We provide the service template to which you can add your code to connect and fetch data and deploy it. After that you can use this service URL in NITRO Forms settings to fetch data Web Service URL – Only for custom option.

Sometimes, we may want to use a different criteria for auto-assignment. For example, for the same Category and Issue Type different staff need to be assigned based on the requester’s location. Here requester’s location can be read from AD/User profile and populated automatically in the Ticket by NITRO Forms. This article describes the steps to auto-assign Tickets based on a different criteria i.e. combination of Category, Issue Type and Requester Location column values. You can use a different combination of columns as per your business process. Please note that this article assumes that Requester Location column value is available on the Ticket form. Using NITRO Forms user information filler settings, it will be auto-filled based the SharePoint logged-in user. And along with location other attributes like email, phone and department can also be auto-filled. Or these attributes can be entered manually in the Ticket. Summary of steps Create a list to store mapping of Category, Issue Type and Location to the user to whom Ticket should be assigned Add entries to the mapping list created in above step Disable standard auto-assignment feature Configure auto-assignment functionality using Crow Canyon NITRO Workflows Detailed Instructions 1. Create a list to store mapping of Category, Issue Type and Location to the required Assigned Staff Create a mapping list called “Assignment Utility” with the list schema as described below. This list is used to maintain the Assigned Staff for all the possible Category, Issue Type and Location combinations. Note that you can give a different name to this list as required. Subsequent steps will use this list to read Assigned Staff from this list based on the Ticket Category, Issue Type and Requester Location and then assign the Ticket to the corresponding staff. Category Internal Name: Category Display Name: Category Issue Type Internal Name: IssueType Display Name: Issue Type   Locations Internal Name: Locations Display Name: Locations Assigned Staff Internal Name: AssignedStaff Display Name: Assigned Staff   2. Configure cascading functionality between Category and Issue Type columns Issue Type values need to filtered based on selected Category. After creating the columns, please follow below steps for this: If you are using SharePoint Online: Go to Application Administration -> Crow Canyon NITRO apps –> Cascaded Lookup and configure the lookup settings as shown below: If you are using SharePoint On-Premises: Go to Site Contents -> Assignment Utility list -> List Settings -> Create column -> Create Issue Type cascaded lookup column like shown below. Note: If you have already created the “Issue Type” lookup column, delete the column and then recreate with Crow Canyon Cascaded lookup column like shown below. 3. Add entries to the mapping list (i.e. Assignment Utility) Create items for every possible Category, Issue Type and Requester Location combination with the associated Assigned Staff. 3. Disable standard auto-assignment feature Go to Issue Type list and remove Assigned Staff column values for all the Issue Types. 4. Configure auto-assignment functionality using Crow Canyon NITRO Workflows Note: Crow Canyon Workflow Manager functionality is same in both SharePoint Online and On-premises and there are only minor differences in the UI. Below images are from SharePoint online and you can follow the same even if you are using SharePoint On-premises. Create a workflow on item creation event in Tickets list as shown below Action 1: Create a Query list action to get the ‘Assigned Staff’ value from Assignment Utility list based on the selected Requester Location, category and Issue Type combination. Note: We do not need to consider the Category in the CAML Query as the cascading feature is already configured in the assignment utility. <View> <Query> <Where> <And> <Contains> <FieldRef Name='Locations'/> <Value Type='Choice'>## RequesterLocation ##</Value> </Contains> <Eq> <FieldRef Name='IssueType' LookupId='TRUE' /> <Value Type='Lookup'>##IssueType##</Value> </Eq> </And> </Where> </View> </Query> Note: In the CAML query, please modify the “RequesterLocation” (highlighted) with internal of the “Requester Location” column in “Tickets” list. Go to Tickets list -> List Settings -> Edit “Requester Location” column and find the internal name at the end of the URL. Action 2: Configure an update item action to assign the tickets Column Mapping: QL_GetAssignmentItem##AssignedStaff Note: If we would like to assign (or re-assign) the Ticket when the Ticket’s Category or Issue Type or Requester Location is updated then"

Admin users who can configure the functionality using Crow Canyon NITRO apps in the site and the end users who can use the system. Please note that NITRO Apps have functionality for cross-site operations. For example, cross-site lookups and associated items are supported on NITRO Forms and reports/list views/list search etc. can show data from other sub-sites within the site collection. Permissions required for these cases are explained later in this article. Permissions required NITRO Component Minimum permissions required for Administrators role Minimum permissions required for User role NITRO Forms Current Site: Manage Web Site permissions (generally it comes with Full Control permissions) Root Site: Read Permissions In general, no special permissions are required to use NITRO Forms, one who has permissions to view/add/edit items can see the NITRO Forms. NITRO Workflows Current Site: Full Control Root Site: Read Same as above NITRO Reports Current Site: To create, edit, delete report, need minimum Add Item, Edit Item and Delete item permissions for the users on the site. Current Site: To add report to the workspace pages, need “Add and Customize Pages” permissions required for the users on the site.

If “Admin” role wants to configure cross-site scenarios then they need to have permissions on those target sites as well. At the same time, user also need to have permissions on corresponding cross-sites. For example, if “Admin” configures “Associated items” on a list from a sub-site in the site collection and adds it to the NITRO Forms then the user who is using the NITRO form need to have permissions on the target list from cross-site to view the associated items. Required permissions for the user role on the cross-site/lists are based on the actions allowed. For example, if “Allow create item/Edit item” actions are enabled in associated items settings then user need to have corresponding permission level (add/edit items) on the target list in sub-site.

For any list, SharePoint generates the item id automatically starting from “1” and then incrementing it for every new item. This same value is copied in the Case Id column of the Ticket. If requirement is to start the Case Id from 5000 instead of default 1, then we need to create 4999 dummy items in the list and then delete them so that new Tickets get the Case Id starting from 5000. This article describes steps to create items in bulk in SharePoint list using PowerShell. We need to follow different steps for SharePoint Online and On-premises environment as described below.

Most common scenario is when a single selection lookup is created in one list to associated one or more items of that list to an item of the list used in the lookup column. For example, a task list having a lookup column of Tickets list. In this case, multiple tasks can have same Ticket as the lookup column value and all these tasks will then be the associated tasks for that Ticket. We can also have the same relation in case of Tasks and sub-tasks wherein the sub-task list will have the lookup to the task list. Using NITRO Forms and Linked Items apps, the associated items can be shown within the form/list view of the main item. That is, Ticket item form will show all the associated tasks for that Ticket and also allow user to add/edit the tasks for that Ticket. In this scenario, it is possible to complete multiple associated tasks in a single operation using NITRO Custom Actions. You can also use the same steps to take other actions on multiple associated items (like re-assign, send mail etc.). In custom actions, we have the ability to query the associated items with the required criteria. These items can be shown to user for further selection. And for the selected items in, we can execute the actions like update item or send mail as per the requirement. This article describes steps to mark complete the user selected sub-tasks of a parent task. Configuration Steps Summary of Steps Required list schema Create custom action to complete the tasks Query list action to get all the open sub-tasks Update item action to complete all the sub-tasks 1. Configure List Schema We need separate lists for Parent Tasks and the Sub-tasks. Sub-tasks list will have a lookup column with lookup list as the Parent Tasks list. 2. Create a custom action on Parent Tasks list to select and complete the sub-tasks Create “Complete Subtasks” custom action in Parent Tasks list as shown below. Go to Parent Tasks list -> List Settings -> Crow Canyon Custom Actions and configure a custom action as shown below: Action 1: Query list Configure a query list action to get all the open sub-tasks that are associated to the parent task Query: <View> <Query> <Where> <And> <Eq> <FieldRef Name='ParentTask' LookupId='TRUE' /> <Value Type='Lookup'>%%[ID|ID]%%</Value> </Eq> <Neq> <FieldRef Name='Status'/> <Value Type='Choice'>Completed</Value> </Neq> </And> </Where> </Query> </View> Action 2: Mark selected sub-tasks as Complete Configure update item action to complete all the sub tasks.   How to execute the action Go to Parent Task list -> Open parent task display form and run the “Complete Subtasks” action.

    "text": " Crow Canyon Applications / How to Parse Email Body to Announcement list fields How to Parse Email Body to Announcement list fields 3201 views 4 min , 24 sec read 2 Applies To : SharePoint Online Description Crow Canyon Email Sync App is used to sync an Exchange Mailbox to an announcement list in O365. We can map the title, body, sender and importance etc. of the email to columns in the announcement list. Please refer Email Sync App manual for more details. In addition to these standard email attributes, this App can parse the email body to extract information with specific format from the content and put it in corresponding SharePoint list columns. This capability can be used wherever mails are generated by other applications. For example, a web form may take user input and then generate a mail with structured content and send to Email Sync mailbox. Or monitoring systems can generate an email with details of problem to generate a Ticket with required data. Email Sync supports some common data formats like “name : value” pairs in the mail body. Also, regular expressions can be specified to parse any kind of custom formats. Summary of steps Configure the SharePoint list schema Configure Email Body Parsing Integration of parsing in our Crow Canyon Service Request applications Detailed Steps: 1. Create the SharePoint list and columns In order to configure Email sync in the application, we can create an Announcement type list in the SharePoint site. This gives us standard email columns to map. After this, create more columns based on information to be extracted from the mail body. Supported column types and formats are listed below Column Type Supported Format Single line of text Free form text (up to 255 characters) Multiple lines of text Only plain text format is supported Choice Valid choice options configured in SharePoint column settings Number Valid Number (Decimal values like 8.35 also supported) Currency Number (currency sign should not be present in mail body) Date Only MM-DD-YYYY Date and Time MM-DD-YYYY HH:MM Lookup Display Name/Lookup ID Yes/No True/False (Yes/No as values – Not supported) Person or Group Display Name/User Id Hyperlink URL, Display Name 2. Configure email body parsing – Predefined formats Email Sync supports two types of pre-defined parsing formats for the mail body as described below. i. Pre-defined format “<List Column Name>:<Value>” In this format, email body has content starting with name of the SharePoint list column followed by a colon and then the value of that column. For example: Category:Network Issue Type:VPN Here, “Category” and “Issue Type” are the display names of the columns in the SharePoint list for which information is present in the mail body. “Network” and “VPN” are the values that need to be put in the Category and Issue Type column in the list item respectively.   Note: The “Column” name should match with the display name of the column present in the announcement list Each line will be parsed separately and if it follows the format and column exists in the list then value will be put in the list item for that column. Column value cannot span more than one line in this format ii. Pre-defined format “[<List Column Name>:<Value>]” This is same as above except the data is within the brackets. So parser will look for starting of the bracket to begin reading the column name. And it will read the value up to the ending bracket. This format is useful if information can span multiple lines. Example: [Category:Network] [Issue Type:VPN] [Additional Info: This is a contoso Request. Requested by Team lead on behalf of his team members] In this case value for column “Additional Info” is spanning two lines as the ending bracket is not in the same line. 3. Configure email body parsing – Custom format In this option, regular expression can be specified as per the content structure of the mail body. You can use this option if data is not in one of the two predefined formats. Following configurations are required for custom format option: Regular Expression – Specify a regular expression to parse the content based on specific pattern. This regular expression need to have two “Groups”, one to match the SharePoint list column name and the second to match the column value RegEx Multiline Mode: Single: Considers pattern for whole mail body as a single line. This means, value for a column could span multiple lines. In regular expression terminology, this means the “Dot matches newline” Multiline: Considers pattern line by line in the mail body. This means each line is parsed separately for the pattern so value of column cannot span multiple lines. Note that one line could have multiple matches depending on how the regular expression is written Sample text in Mail body to extract value : ##Category:Network## ##Issue Type:VPN## ##Additional Information:Contoso Text## For the above text parsing, we can use simple regular expression as given below: ##(.+?):(.+?)## Note : The “Column” name"

    "text": " Duplicate email notifications in Crow Canyon Application Duplicate email notifications in Crow Canyon Application 1101 views 1 min , 35 sec read 0 Applies To SharePoint Online and SharePoint On-Premises Issue Duplicate notifications are received by Requester/Assigned Staff etc. roles on Ticket. Cause On Ticket creation, Crow Canyon application sets certain hidden fields (like Case Id etc.) and updates the Ticket item. If any NITRO Workflows are configured on the Tickets list that are triggered on item creation and update the Ticket, then multiple updates could be happening on the same Ticket item in fraction of seconds. Each of these update events trigger the workflows which could run simultaneously on same state of Ticket and this could lead to duplicate mails. Resolution Optimize the workflows configurations as described below such that we can eliminate duplicate notifications. Delay Execution If workflows are configured on Ticket creation event, then it is very likely that multiple updates will happen on the Ticket by Crow Canyon application and Workflows simultaneously. In this scenario, we can add delay to workflow execution (maximum 30 seconds). This delay can be added at the workflow level or at the action Disable Event fire (only On-Prem) Workflows On-Premises has an option to not trigger workflows when an item is created/updated via a Workflow Action. This is controlled via “Disable event fire” option as shown below: If this option is enabled for any action and an item gets updated/created by that action, then this will not trigger workflows that are configured on update/create event for that item. Note that if user updates the item or creates the item from SharePoint UI then workflows will trigger. This option is only to prevent Workflows triggering in loop. Reduce the number of updates on same item by merging multiple actions with required conditions For example, requirement could be to that on Ticket create event: Update the Priority based on the Ticket Category Update the Due Date based on Category or some other column value Instead of creating two different workflows (or two different actions) to update the Priority and Due Date of the Ticket separately, do this update in a single action. This may require that multiple Actions have to be configured for different values of Category, and at most only one of them will match the conditions. E.g. If ‘Category’ = ‘Spam’, set ‘Priority’ = ‘Normal’ and set ‘Due Date’ = 2 Days from today If ‘Category’ = ‘Access’, set ‘Priority’ = ‘Normal’ and set ‘Due Date’ = 1 Days from today If ‘Category’ = ‘VPN’, set ‘Priority’ = ‘High’ and set ‘Due Date’ = 1 Days from today There will be multiple update item actions in the Workflow to handle these business scenarios, and each action will have a specific set of conditions for execution. Ticket will be updated only once for both Priority and Due Date value thus reducing the number of updates and consequently reducing unnecessary workflow triggers. Please note that delay and disable events settings mentioned above can be used along with these configurations. About supportTeam View all posts by supportTeam → © 2025 Crow Canyon Systems, Inc.

Same approach can be used to configure approvals in any application like Purchase Order, Request Management etc. Also, if more approval levels are required then similar instructions can be followed to add additional levels. In this example, if a Ticket list item is created with a particular category for which approval is required then approval flow is initiated. Approver is assigned a task and a notification is sent so he/she can approve/deny the approval request. Once the approver takes the decision by updating the task, Ticket approval status is updated and Ticket requester is notified. Summary of steps 1. List Schema Category list Create Approver Definition list Create Approval Tasks list Create required fields in Tickets list 2.  Configure Custom Actions for approval process Summary of steps is given here, detailed steps are in this article Tickets list Submit for Approval This action will initiate the approval process. Based on the selected Category, it will query the approvers in the Approval Definition list, create required task for approver and updates the Ticket approval status. Action 1: QL_Approver Definition  This action will get the approvers from Approver Definition list based on the selected Category in the Ticket. Action 2: Approve This action will approve the Ticket either “the level 2 approval task is approved” or “level 1 task is approved but level 2 approver is empty in the definition”. Action 3: Submit for level 2 Approver This action will create the task for level 2 approver when level 1 approver approve. Action 4: Update Ticket Approval Status II This action will update the Ticket approval level when level 1 approver approve. Action 5: Submit for Level 1 Approver This action will create the task for level 1 approver Action 6: Update Ticket Approval Status I This action will update the approval level and approval status in the Ticket when level 1 task is created Approval Task list: Approve This action approves the current task and updates the Ticket approval status/level. In this action we will invoke the “Submit for Approval” custom action configured in the Tickets list that processes the next level approval. Deny This action sets the approval status of the Ticket to Denied. 3. Configure workflows for auto notification Summary of steps is given here, detailed steps are in this article Workflow 1: Notify approver on task creation Workflow 2: Notify Requester on Ticket Approve/Deny 4. Configure NITRO forms for the lists Tickets list Approval Tasks list   Detailed Instructions 1. List Schema To configure the approval feature, we need to create certain lists and fields as per the requirement, below are the details of schema that supports our current approval scenario. Category list This article assumes that Category list is present in the application site and Tickets list has a Category lookup column. By default, Crow Canyon standard product comes with Category list and a Category lookup column in Tickets list. Approval Definition list Create a list with custom list template and name it as ‘Approval Definition’ and then create below required fields in this list. Category (Lookup pointing to Category list) Internal Name: Category Display Name: Category Purpose: Used to query the approvers in the custom action Level 1 Approver (‘Person or Group’ column type with ‘People Only’ option) Internal Name: L1Approver Display Name: Level 1 Approver Purpose: Used to define level 1 approver for this type of Category Level 2 Approver (‘Person or Group’ column type with ‘People Only’ option) Internal Name: L2Approver Display Name: Level 2 Approver Purpose: Used to define level 2 approver for this type of Category Approval Tasks list Create a task list with Tasks list template and name it as ‘Approval Tasks’ list and then create below required columns in this list. Delete Related Items, Predecessor, Start Date columns from the list. Rename “Task Status” column to “Approval Decision” and remove default choice values and add below values Approved Denied Approval Level (Choice: Level 1, Level 2) Internal Name: ApprovalLevel Display Name: Approval Level Purpose: Indicates the current approval level Related Ticket (Lookup pointing to Tickets list) Internal Name: RelatedTicket Display Name: Related Ticket Purpose: It indicates the approval process for the related Ticket Comments (Multiple lines of plain text) Internal Name: Comments Display Name: Comments Purpose: To capture the approver comments and will be copied to related Ticket.

Total time spent on the Ticket is the sum of time values entered in these Time Tracking items that are related to that Ticket. If Ticket has an estimated time column, then it is possible to calculate and show the actual time spent as a percentage of the estimated time. This can then be used for reporting purposes and identify where estimated time is significantly in variance with actual time based on say staff, category etc. This article describes how to calculate total time spent based on Time Tracking entries of the Ticket and update this value in a column in the Ticket. And then create a calculated column for total time as the percentage of estimated time. Summary of Steps List Schema changes Time Tracking list Tickets list Configure Workflow to calculate and put the the value of Total time in Tickets item Create calculated column for percentage Detail Steps 1. List Schema Time Tracking list No changes required as this is part of standard application and has the required columns and the Tickets list has a column to show associated “Time Tracking” items. Tickets list Create below columns in Tickets list, note that you can specify different names as required: Total Work (Number) Internal Name: TotalWork Display Name: Total Work Estimated Hours (Number) Internal Name: EstimatedHours Display Name: Estimated Hours After creating these columns, add them to NITRO forms. Go to Tickets list -> List Settings -> Crow Canyon NITRO forms -> New Form, Edit Form and Display Form –> Add these two columns to NITRO forms and publish the forms. 2. Configure Workflow to update Total work in Tickets list Configure a workflow to update the “Total Work” value in Tickets list from the “Time Tracking” list entries. Configure workflow as shown below on Item create and Item modified events on Time Tracking list. Conditions: Duration Hours equal afterchange:[[Any]] Duration Minutes equal afterchange:[[Any]] Action 1: Query List Create Query list action to get all the related Time Tracking entries for the ticket. Query: <Where> <Eq> <FieldRef Name=' TicketID ' LookupId='TRUE' /> <Value Type='Lookup'>## TicketID ##</Value> </Eq> </Where> Note: In the above query, please use internal name of “Related Ticket ID” column in Time Tracking list in place of “TicketId” (highlighted in red). Action 2: Update Item Create an update item action to update the “Total Work” value in the Ticket. Column Mapping: Total Work: GetRelatedTimeTrackings##$sum([Total Work|TotalWork])   Create a calculated column in Tickets list This column will have the total time as percentage of the estimated time.

Often, we need to show/hide columns based on the value selected in other column(s). We can use Column Permissions feature to implement this quickly without any code. In this article, we are considering “Resolution” and “Resolution Notes” as two columns on the New/Edit form. Requirement is to show “Resolution Notes” column on the form only when “Resolution” is not empty. If “Resolution” is empty then “Resolution Notes” should not be visible. Column Permission Configurations This requires two permissions on “Resolution Notes” column: First permission hides the “Resolution Notes” column without checking any conditions Second permission conditionally shows the “Resolution Notes” column. If “Resolution” column has a value, then it shows the “Resolution Notes” column Hide Permission Show Permission Note We need to enable “Dynamic condition evaluation” as shown below. This means that whenever user changes the value of “Resolution” column on the form, these permissions are evaluated again to determine if “Resolution Notes” should be displayed or not For this scenario, “Hide permission has higher priority in case of multiple permissions” should not be checked. Since first permission that hides the column has no conditions, checking this option will mean that it will always take precedence and column will never be shown on the form NITRO Studio- Forms About supportTeam View all posts by supportTeam → Related Articles NITRO Studio Workshop: NITRO on the Go!

Note: Creation of portal site is same for both SharePoint online and on-premises, only the user interface may differ. After creating the portal site, we need to configure the portal site for the specific application and this is done with portal template files that have the required settings. We will send these portal tempalte files as part of the service request application installation package (i.e. IT Premium/Facilities/Request Management applications). Upload template files to corresponding document libraries Go to Portal Site -> “PortalSettings” document library -> upload “t_PortalSettings.xml” file Go to Portal Site -> Site Assets -> Create folder with name “CCS” -> Create another folder “Forms” with in the “CCS” folder -> Upload “t_forms_[[KnowledgeBaseListID]].xml and t_forms_[[TicketsListID]].xml” files in “Forms” folder Go to Portal Site -> Site Assets -> Create a new folder “LinkContent” and upload the below files in this folder: 566b24f2-57de-4d8f-a26f-b6cc475d88bf.txt 51233f2c-1873-48b6-9e29-93d4390e60f0.txt b23a4b41-fa17-4b69-9088-6c7c528613b7.txt b545bf73-c890-4a9b-9b9e-bba0b13d66b8.txt Process the template files Go to Portal Site -> Site Pages -> Open “Template Settings” page and process portal settings, Work Order list forms and Knowledge base list forms. Configure Portal Settings file 1. Select the “/PortalSetttings” under Folder Url, select “t_PortalSettings.xml” under “Template File” Note: This article is same for IT, Facilities and Request Management applications and only difference is the name of the main list (Tickets list). Below instructions are given as per Tickets list name, please use the corresponding list name based on the application that you are installing. For IT Premium application – ‘Tickets’ For Facilities application – ‘Work Orders’ For Request Management application – ‘Requests’ 2. Configure placeholder values by editing all of them with the appropriate value.

    "text": " Site URL Change for NITRO Application Site URL Change for NITRO Application 2747 views 5 min , 46 sec read 7 Applies To : SharePoint On-Premises and NITRO Studio based applications Description This article lists the configurations required when SharePoint site URL is changed for a site using Crow Canyon NITRO Studio. This can be the case when when SSL is configured for a site (http://… to https://…) or when alternate access mapping is configured for the web application. There could also be the case of directly changing the site URL after installation of Crow Canyon applications. Case 1: Multiple URLs for site Alternate access mappings are configured to access the sites for the web application with multiple URLs Case 2: Single URL for site Alternate access mappings are configured to change URL, site is accessed only using this single URL Subsite URL is changed manually SSL is applied to the site (http://… to https://…) For any of the above cases then URL change configurations have to be done and alternate access mapping URLs need to be specified in the Crow Canyon Site Settings. Case 1: Multiple URLs 1. Upgrade NITRO Studio for the site Go to the Application Site -> Site Settings -> Crow Canyon NITRO Apps -> Click “UPDATE THIS SITE” link (if available) to upgrade the NITRO Studio for the site. If link is not visible then site is already updated and no action is required for this step. 2. Configure Alternate Access Mapping URLs in Crow Canyon NITRO Site Settings. Go to Application site -> Site Settings -> Crow Canyon NITRO Site Settings and configure the alternate access mapping URLs. Please enter all valid URLs of the site collection in separate lines as shown below: Note: Ticket links in the auto notifications (Application Administration -> Notification) will point to the “Default URL Zone” that is set for the web application in the SharePoint server. To modify these links with alternate access mapping URL, go to SharePoint Central Administration -> System Settings -> Farm Management-> Configure Alternate Access Mappings -> Check and update the default URL as needed. This default URL will be used in the auto notifications. 3. Configure the URLs in the NITRO Apps with server relative URLs Application Administration URL configuration Modify the URL to the server relative URL and configure the Application Administration with new URL in Crow Canyon Branding. Sample URL: http://crowcanyon:3000/sites/Nitro/ITPremimum/Workspaces/Configuration.aspx Server Relative URL: /sites/Nitro/ITPremimum/Workspaces/Configuration.aspx Go to Application Site -> Site Settings -> Crow Canyon Branding (Classic sites) -> General Settings -> Remove the Application Administration URL and reconfigure with new server relative URL: Change URLs in Crow Canyon Tiles and Dials Go to Application Site -> Site Settings -> Crow Canyon Tiles and Dials -> Tiles -> Modify the URLs in Header and Body navigation URLs with server relative URLs (for server relative URL, please refer above section). Similarly modify the URLs in Link Tiles where the “Tile Type” is “URL”. If there are no Tiles or Link tiles configured then ignore this step. Portal Quick Ticket links Go to the Portal site -> Portal Settings -> Home Page Settings -> Quick Links -> Edit the Tile and modify the navigation URL with server relative URL.

This is useful if you have data of existing Contracts in an Excel and want to have it in the application. Prerequisites Before importing the Contracts data, SharePoint list schema should have the possible options that imported Contracts will refer. Lookup Columns Ensure that all possible options exist in the related lists of the Contract. For e.g., if a Contract in Excel has a particular Vendor value, then Vendor item with same name should be present in the Vendor list before importing the Contract. So we need to import all the lookup list items before importing the main Contracts list items. In Contract Management application we have below lookup columns in Contracts list: Vendor Renewal Option Department Choice Columns Ensure that all the possible choice column options are present in the SharePoint list column settings. In Contract Management application we have below choice columns in Contracts list: Type of Contract Payment Terms Currency Type Required Columns Below columns are required columns in the Contracts list, please ensure that the Excel Sheet has some information in these columns. Title Renewal Option Start Date Expiration Date Value Data Import Please refer this article to import the Excel data into the Contracts list. Once all the Contracts are imported, upload the Contracts documents manually in Contract Internal documents list and link them to the corresponding contracts. Approval Process Contract approval can be done before importing the items into SharePoint application. Otherwise, import the Contracts with “Active” status and then initiate the approval process manually for the required contracts. To initiate the approval process manually for multiple Contracts easily, please change the settings of the custom action “Submit for Renewal”. You can revert back this setting after initiating the approval as required. Go to Contracts site -> Contracts list -> Custom Actions -> Edit “Submit for Renewal” custom action and enable the “List View Ribbon” and check “Enable for multiple items” as shown below:   After above change, navigate to the Contracts list view, select required Contracts and click “Submit for Renewal” action button to initiate the approval process:     About supportTeam View all posts by supportTeam → © 2025 Crow Canyon Systems, Inc.

For example, get all open Tasks related to a Ticket or get all line items for a Purchase Request. Retrieved list items can then be used in other actions, some examples of this usage are given below: Cancel all open Tasks of the Ticket when Ticket is cancelled Calculate the sum of cost of all line items Create an Asset for each of the line items of a Purchase Request Check if all Tasks related to a Request are ‘Closed’ and if so then mark the Request as Completed Custom Actions are used extensively in NITRO based applications and Query List action is indispensable whenever we have to deal with items that are related to each other. Main input for this action is the site and list from which items have to be fetched and the filter criteria for the items. This action is cross-site capable and can fetch items from any site in the site-collection as long as the user executing the action has the required permissions. Below sections explain the various configuration options in more detail. Detailed Description Please note that at most 50 items are fetched for the Query list action due to performance considerations. For end-user based scenarios this should cover most of the cases. Run for Query List action runs in the context of a item and subsequent options depend on this selection. Current Item : It is the item on which user has invoked the custom action from the SharePoint UI. For example, while working with a Purchase Request, we will select this option to get all line items associated with the Purchase Request Lookup : It is the item selected in the lookup column of the item on which user has invoked the custom action from the SharePoint UI. For example, Purchase Request has a lookup column for a Purchase Order item. While invoking custom action on Purchase Request, we can select this lookup column to get items associated with the Purchase Order. That way, we can do operations based on items associated with a lookup list item of the current item Type Whether to get a single item or a collection of items. This depends on the business use case. Query Site Select the site of the list from which items have to be fetched. Items can be fetched from any site within the site collection. Based on site selection, next drop-down for the lists will be populated Query List Select list from which items have to be fetched. Please note that next option depends on this selection. Get Item(s) From Lookup column This option will show a drop-down to select the lookup columns from the list of the item selected in ‘Run for’ option. Note that these lookup columns should be for the list selected in the ‘Query List’ option above. A lookup column contains (or references) items from another list (lookup list specified in the lookup column settings). This option will read these items from the lookup column of the item selected in the ‘Run for’ option: Related Items For this scenario, list selected in the ‘Query List’ should have a lookup to the list of the item selected in the ‘Run for’ option. For example, Tasks list having a lookup to Request list and action being configured on Request list. This option will fetch all Tasks that are related to Request filtered by the selected view (like only open/closed Tasks as per the view conditions). List View Fetch items from the list selected in the ‘Query List’ option based on the selected ‘List View’. In this case it is not necessary that there are any lookup column relations between list of the item selected in the ‘Run for’ option and the list selected in the ‘Query List’ option. Items will be fetched based on the conditions specified in the View conditions Query Builder Fetch items from the list selected in the ‘Query List’ option based on the conditions specified in the Query Builder. In this case it is not necessary that there are any lookup column relations between list of the item selected in the ‘Run for’ option and the list selected in the ‘Query List’ option. Column placeholders from the item selected in the ‘Run for’ option can be specified in the conditions. Placeholder Syntax: %%[Column Display Name|Column Internal Name]%% E.g. %%[ID|ID])%% Query Fetch items from the list selected in the ‘Query List’ option based on the specified CAML query. In this case it is not necessary that there are any lookup column relations between list of the item selected in the ‘Run for’ option and the list selected in the ‘Query List’ option. Please refer CAML query syntax from this article . Column placeholders from the item selected in the ‘Run for’ option can be specified in the query.

    "text": " Generate a custom unique ID for SharePoint list items Generate a custom unique ID for SharePoint list items 5397 views 1 min , 40 sec read 1 Applies to: SharePoint Online and On-Premises Description SharePoint generates a unique ID for each list item. This Id is numeric that is incremented for each new item. For many business scenarios, it is required to have an alpha-numeric Id. For example, for a Purchase Order it could be PO-<YEAR>-<Id>. Here the Id contains a fixed prefix PO, 4 digit running year and a unique Id. This article describes the steps to generate the custom unique Id for each item in required format. This process uses the SharePoint generated numeric Id as part of the alpha-numeric Id so that it is guaranteed to be unique for each item. These steps take the example where Id is based on values in the list item column ‘Department’, current year (as per item creation time) and the SharePoint generated item Id. Example: “IT/2019/00001” “IT” represents the Department “2019” represents the current year “0000” is the prefix for the Item Id “1” is the SharePoint generated unique item Id Summary of Steps Configure Execute Script action in Custom Action This action generates the unique ID Invoke custom action in NITRO form Detailed Steps 1. Configure Execute script action in Custom Action to generate unique Id Add a new custom action with an execute script action as shown below. This action generates the unique custom Id for the Purchase Request based on Department Id, Current Year and SharePoint generated unique Item Id. Note: Below action will work for new items. For existing items you can configure a similar action with added conditions so that it is visible only for older items where unique Id is not set. Additional conditions will be to check that “Purchase Request #” is empty. More conditions can be added as required such as based on status. Enable this custom action for multiple items by selecting option “List View Ribbon” and “Enable for multiple items” in the custom action configuration.

Determine the Id of the list: Open the site in Chrome browser -> Go to Site Contents -> Tickets list -> List Settings -> Note the list id in the URL, refer example below: https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/nitro1/ITPremium/_layouts/15/listedit.aspx?List= 00907660-856b-4cb2-8ac7-3fd695dc2f0c Navigate to the NITRO Forms settings file folder: Go to ‘Site Assets’ document library from the site contents page and then navigate to folder “CCS” and then “Forms” folder inside it Search for files with name of the list Id noted in above step. There will be two files: File with name as the list Id only: This is the file that has the current published settings and these are the settings that are used by the list forms File with name as the list Id appended with “_draft”: This is the draft settings file. If you have saved the settings in designer but not yet published, then these will be different from published settings. If settings are published then contents in this file will be same as the published file Restore the settings file version: Click on the ECB (3 dots next to file name as shown in UI below) to bring up the menu Click ‘Version History’ option to bring up the file versions Select the required version and click ‘Restore’ as shown below This process can be done for both draft and the published file Open the NITRO Forms designer for the list and publish the settings again to clear the cache new settings to take effect   Images below show how to restore the immediate previous version to current settings of NITRO Forms: About supportTeam View all posts by supportTeam → © 2025 Crow Canyon Systems, Inc.

For example, we can auto-fill the user’s name, email, department etc. when submitting a request. In some scenarios, there is a requirement to fill the logged-in user in a “Person or Group” column when a specific value is entered in a column on the form. In this case, we can use Form Event Actions feature of the NITRO forms. Instructions This article describes Form Event action configurations so that whenever “Status” column value is set to ‘Active’ and “Project Manager” column value is empty, then fill the current logged in user in the “Project Manager” column. You can use similar settings with different columns and values as per your business scenario. Go to the list -> List Settings -> Crow Canyon NITRO forms -> Advanced Settings pane on the left -> Form Event Actions and configure as shown below. After configuring the Form Event actions publish the NITRO Forms. Please note that you may have to refresh the forms a couple of times as NITRO Forms settings may be cached. Script: return _spPageContextInfo.userEmail;   Note: Please ensure that sure that the “Person Or Group” column is added to a tab/section on the form. If this column should not be shown to user then we can hide it using column permission configurations in NITRO Forms. You can also refer this article for some sample configurations using form event actions feature in NITRO Forms. About supportTeam View all posts by supportTeam → © 2025 Crow Canyon Systems, Inc.

This can be based on data format (like email, phone etc.), length of entered data, specific values etc. Also, validations can be conditional based on data in other columns and even based on membership of logged-in user. In some cases advanced validations may be required and these can be configured by adding the required script on the form. This article describes the steps to configure validation on a date column such that entered date should be at least 14 days from today (this validation is required only on the new item form). Detailed Steps Go to Site Content -> Navigate to the required list -> Click on List Settings -> Open Crow Canyon NITRO Forms. In NITRO Forms designer left pane, click ‘Layouts and Theme’ section. Check “Hide Save Button” option and set “Bottom Action Panel Button Align” option to ‘Right’ as shown below:   Note : Form shown above is using separate forms for New / Edit / Display. This validation can be configured with common form as well by adding two separate submit action buttons. Configure permissions on one submit action for ‘ID’ as “is empty” and this button. With this condition, it will only be shown for new item form and validation script will be configured for this button as described below. For the other submit button, configure permissions for ‘ID’ as “is not empty” and this button will not have the script since it will be shown for edit and display of the items.   Next, drag and drop Submit Action from “Actions” menu in the left panel: Click Submit Action button to show its properties in the right panel. Configure the button title, icon and validation script in the right panel. Date column validation script: var varDate = new Date(); varDate.setDate(varDate.getDate() + 14); var dueDate = formContext.fetchColumnValueUI(\"DueDate\"); var validationPassed = false; if (dueDate) { if (typeof dueDate == \"string\") { dueDate = dueDate.replace(/-/g, \" \"); } validationPassed = Date.parse(dueDate) >= Date.parse(new Date(varDate.toDateString())); } if(validationPassed == false){ functionCallback(true, \"Due Date cannot be less than 14 days from today\"); return; } functionCallback(); Note : In the above script, “DueDate” is the internal name of the Date and Time column on the form for which validation is configured. Replace it with the internal name of the column on your form.   After adding the script, click Apply as shown above and publish the NITRO Forms. Note that you may have to refresh the actual NITRO form a couple of times as NITRO forms settings are cached to improve performance.   About supportTeam View all posts by supportTeam → © 2025 Crow Canyon Systems, Inc.

How to configure permissions for KB articles in Crow Canyon Applications? 1605 views 1 min , 37 sec read 4 Applies to : SharePoint Online and SharePoint On-Premises Description Knowledge Base (KB) is a repository of information to solve the frequently occurring issues. It also has data from resolved Tickets so that users can refer this information if they are facing the problem that has been solved before. KB articles are organized by Category and Issue Type. KB articles are available in backend site for the staff users and also in portal site for the end users. By default all KB articles are available in portal site for end users. If there is a requirement to have certain KB articles only for staff then these can be restricted from showing in the portal site. For this, item level permissions have to be configured on KB articles. This article describes the steps to configure workflows to manage permissions for Knowledge Base articles using NITRO Workflow Manager component. Instructions Standard application has a column “Target Audience” in Knowledge Base list. This article describes permission configurations based on this column. “Target Audience” column has two choice options: “Internal Staff” and “External”. If “Target Audience” is set to “Internal” for a KB article then it should be shown only to staff users in backend site. In this case we can grant permissions only to the internal staff so that such KBs won’t appear in portal for end users. If “Target Audience” column value is empty or External then no change is required in the permissions and such KBs will be shown to both staff and end users. Note: In this sample article we have configured workflows based on “Target Audience” column, we can use similar settings for some other column as required. Workflows Configuration Go to Application Administration -> Crow Canyon NITRO Apps -> NITRO Workflows and configure the workflow as shown below: Workflow 1: Item Created – Knowledge Base list If KB is marked as “Internal Staff”, then this workflow will grant permissions to KB article only to specific groups: Action: Manage Permissions Configure manage permissions action as shown below: Note: We can select required permission level for the groups based on our business scenario. Workflow 2: Item Updated – Knowledge Base list Configure workflow on item update event as shown below. This workflow will updates the permissions when the “Target Audience” column value is changed: Action 1: Manage Permissions to give access only to staff This action will remove permissions for all users and grant permissions only to the specified groups when “Target Audience” column value is changed from “External” to “Internal Staff”: Note: We can select the required permission level for the groups based on the business scenario. Action 2: Manage Permissions to give access to all users This action will remove unique permissions and revert back to standard permissions as per the KB list so that all users have access to the article. This is done when the “Target Audience” column value is changed from “Internal Staff” to “External”: About supportTeam View all posts by supportTeam → © 2025 Crow Canyon Systems, Inc.

It provides mail template feature so that emails can be quickly composed with details of the list item for which email is being sent. It is also possible to include details of the logged-in user sending the mail like his/her name, phone and email address. This is useful since logged-in user is the email sender and may want to include his details automatically rather than typing the same information for every mail. Instructions To include the logged-in user details in the Mail Template, go to the Tickets list (list for which Email Manager is configured) -> List Settings -> Crow Canyon Mail Templates -> Edit the mail template and add place holders under section “Logged-in User Info” to the mail template (e.g. “Display Name” as shown below) and save the settings: Once this template is saved, it will start populating the logged-in user information when it is used for sending the mail. If required, we can set a mail template as the “Default Mail Template”. Please refer image below:   Note: If “Logged-in User Info” is not shown in Mail Templates configuration page then update the NITRO for the site: Go to Application Administration -> Crow Canyon NITRO Apps -> Crow Canyon NITRO Studio -> Click on “UPDATE THE SITE”.

Replies are linked to existing Tickets and if email cannot be matched to an existing Ticket then a new Ticket is created. The matching algorithm is configurable and parameters used are: Case Id : Application generates a unique Case Id for each Ticket. This Id is added to subject of outgoing mails related to the Ticket. If user replies to such emails, then based on this Id email is linked to the existing Ticket having that Id Conversation Id (Message-ID) : Email providers assign a unique identifier to every email. This message Id is available in reply mails and is used by mail clients to show a conversation view of the related emails. We use the same technique if ‘Case Id’ is not found in the subject Email Subject : If above two checks do not give a match, application performs additional checks to match based on subject of the email. In addition to subject other parameters like email sender, date of Ticket creation with matching subject, Ticket status and original mail body are matched to find the most appropriate Ticket to link the email Matching based on ‘Case Id’ and email subject is part of standard product. Please refer below configuration details to enable matching based on Conversation Id and parameters that control the overall matching behavior. Configuration Details Matching functionality is part of Crow Canyon Product App component and installation is required. Please refer below details to create the columns in lists to enable and control the functionality. Note that you can change the display name of the columns after creating them with the names given below: List Name Column Name and Type Description ‘Email Tickets’ and ‘Tickets’ CCSConversationId (Single Line of Text) This column stores the Conversation Id (Message-ID) of the email. This column need not be shown in Views and Forms as it is only for internal use by the application. ‘Email Tickets’ CCSOriginalTo (Single Line of Text) This column stores the information about the email recipients as received in the original email. It is used in matching sender when subsequent replies are received. This column need not be shown in Views and Forms as it is only for internal use by the application. ‘Configurations’ EmailMatchingSettings (Multi-line Plain Text) This column is used to specify options to control the behavior of email matching. Each option is given in a separate line with format as shown below: MatchOption=3 MatchConversationDays=30 MatchSubjectDays=7 DisableMatchForSenders= DisableMatchForStatus=;Closed; Please refer below for more details on each option. Note: This is plain text data and should not contain any HTML tags The values shown above are used as default if this column doesn’t exist or has invalid or null data This column should be added to the list form so that you can modify the value as required Configuration options S. No. Option Name Option Description 1. MatchOption Numeric values to control the overall matching behavior. Note that ‘Case Id’ based matching is always enabled and not affected by this setting. 0 : Set zero value to disable matching by conversation, subject and sender. 1 : Set value of one to enable matching by conversation 2 : Set value of two to enable matching by mail subject 3 : Set value of three to enable matching by conversation Id and subject. Conversation Id based match is tried first and if that doesn’t give any matching email then subject based matching is tried 2. MatchConversationDays Numeric value that specifies the number of days past today for which Tickets should be checked for conversation Id match. Tickets created in this interval will be matched and Tickets created prior won’t be matched 3. MatchSubjectDays Numeric value that specifies the number of days past today for which Tickets should be checked for subject match. Tickets created in this interval will be matched and Tickets created prior won’t be matched 4. DisableMatchForSenders Matching can be disabled for specific senders like in case of emails generated by automated systems. Format for this option is one or more email addresses separated by semicolon. Please keep the value for this as blank in case you don’t want to disable for any sender. Value format: ;mail1@abc.com;mail2@abc.com; 5.

It also provides a host of features to do operations on listed items. This articles lists the advanced features of this component for use in various business applications. Detailed Description Delay loading of items Enabling this option will delay the loading of items in List View web part in page. This will increase the performance of a page in case of multiple web parts exists in a page. Load after Items will load automatically after the specified time in the list view web part. User can also use “Click to load items” link to load the items manually. User initiated Items will not load automatically in the list view web part, we need to click “Click to load items” link to load the items. Hide Export to Excel Button Use this option to hide the “Export to Excel” button from the List View web part. Column Width JSON To have specific width for columns in the List View grid, specify the column internal name along with width in pixels in JSON format. Ex: { \"LinkTitle\": { \"width\": 150 }, \"Title\": { \"width\": 150 }, \"ID\": { \"width\": 80 } } Note: Specify column internal names and not the display names of the columns in the JSON Extended Settings JSON Example configuration: { \"Export\" : { \"AllowedGroups\" : [\"NITRO Members\", \"NITRO Owners\"], \"ColumnsToExport\" : [\"AssetID\",\"Title\",\"AssetCategory\"], \"ExcludeColumns\" : [\"LinkTitle\"] } } 1. Export to Excel feature customization Currently, extended JSON settings can be used for customizing the Excel to Export feature. Please follow the above format, details are given below: a. AllowedGroups “Export to Excel” button will be visible only for the users in SharePoint groups specified in this node. Multiple groups can be specified and if logged-in user is not in any of these groups then button will be hidden. This settings is optional, if it is not specified then all users will see the button. Also refer NITRO Site Settings for site level permissions for Export to Excel feature. As per the above sample configuration, “Export to Excel” button will be visible only for the users in “NITRO Owners” and “NITRO Members” groups. b. Columns included in the exported data By default all columns present in the selected view are exported. If advanced settings are specified then below rules are applied: Column has to be present in the selected view If ”ColumnsToExport” node is present, then only those columns that are specified in this node will be exported If “ExcludeColumns” node is present, then columns specified in this node will be excluded As per the above sample configuration, “AssetID”, “Title” and “AssetCategory” columns will be exported provided they are present in the view. “LinkTitle” column will be excluded from the export even if it is present in the selected view. Note We need to use the internal name of the column in Extended Settings JSON. List View Example 2. List View Font Size Using this configuration, we can configure the font size for header (columns) in list view and the list item column values using JSON. Example JSON { \"ShowWebpartTitle\": false, \"HideViewVersions\": false, \"Styles\": { \"Header\": { \"FontSize\": \"15px\", //Columns names in header of Crow Canyon list view \"ColumnWidthScale\": 0.5 //value range is 0.1 to 1 }, \"Content\": { \"FontSize\": \"10px\" //column values for items in Crow Canyon List view }, \"Footer\": { \"FontSize\": \"10px\" //aggregates like count, sum used in Crow Canyon list view } } } ‘ColumnWidthScale’ parameter in above sample JSON can be used to decrease default column width by specified number. For example, 0.5 will reduce column width to half. This can be used in conjunction with small font size for Header to have more columns in the available width. This can be used to see more content without horizontal scrolling. Example Configuration Sample Output: 3. Disable hyperlinks In NITRO list views, below columns types are shown as hyperlinks. Lookup (single/multi-selection) NITRO attachments column NITRO Attachments column (lookup and NITRO attachments columns in associated list view) If required we can disable the hyperlinks using extended settings. Hyperlinks can be disabled for all the columns or specific columns. To disable hyperlinks for all columns, go to the site -> Site Settings -> Crow Canyon List view -> Create or edit existing list view definition -> Navigate to “Advanced Settings” tab -> Extended Settings JSON -> add “DisableHyperLinks” property to ‘true’ as shown below: To disable hyperlinks for specific columns, provide the column internal names in an array.

To view and configure these settings, navigate to SharePoint site settings page and then click the site settings link: <Site URL>/_layouts/15/settings.aspx => “Crow Canyon NITRO Site Settings” Details of each option are given below. Regional Time Settings Use this section to configure the date and time format for use in NITRO components. Time zone : This is read-only and shown as per configurations in site regional settings Date Format : Specify the date format to use in NITRO components like Forms and List Views Time Format : Specify the date format to use in NITRO components like Forms and List Views Full Date Format : As per the date and time format specified above   Cache Site Metadata This section can be used to enable or disable caching of site metadata. Also, cache can be reset for all users from this section. This includes information about the site lists and columns, list views, Forms settings etc. Note that this does not include data stored in list items which is never cached. To improve the page load speed, it is recommended that this setting is always enabled. This data is frequently used by various NITRO components. For example, NITRO Forms and List Views need the information about columns in lists to draw the appropriate controls and show data in correct format as per the data type of the columns. Instead of fetching this information from SharePoint every time, caching enables NITRO to store this in user’s browser cache for faster access. If any changes are made to list columns or portal settings etc., users can clear the browser cache to get the updated settings immediately. Or, site administrator can do a ‘Reset Cache’ from this section so that NITRO components will fetch the metadata again on next operation by users. Note that users may have to refresh the browser twice to see the updated settings.   List Action Remover This section can be used to remove unwanted action buttons from the List ribbon. List Actions Security Settings To have more granular control on specific list actions, specify the SharePoint groups that can perform the operations. Export to Excel Specify site groups allowed to export list items data to Excel. Standard SharePoint List View action to export to Excel Button in SharePoint List Views is hidden if logged-in user is not a member of any of the groups specified in this setting. If no groups are specified then button is shown as per default SharePoint behavior. NITRO Export to Excel feature NITRO List View and List search have an export to Excel feature. This feature is hidden if logged-in user is not a member of any of the groups specified in this setting. Each instance of NITRO List View and List Search have its own settings that can be used to override this behavior. For more details, refer these articles: NITRO List View NITRO List search NITRO List and Item Print In SharePoint List Views, Item Forms and NITRO Forms there is an option to print list item(s). Print is not allowed if logged-in user is not a member of any of the groups specified in this setting. If no groups are specified then print is allowed as per SharePoint permissions of the user on the list and items. In NITRO list view, print button is hidden as per these settings. Each instance of NITRO List View has its own settings that can be used to override this behavior. Please refer this article for more details.

    "text": " Crow Canyon Email Sync: Use Graph API to read emails Crow Canyon Email Sync: Use Graph API to read emails 1522 views 2 min , 4 sec read 1 Applies to: SharePoint Online Description Email Sync app is used to sync emails from a Microsoft Exchange mailbox to a list in SharePoint Online. SharePoint online doesn’t have built-in functionality similar to Announcements Lists in on-premises where emails sent to a particular address are automatically added to the list in SharePoint. You can read more about Email sync here and here . To access the mailbox to read emails, there are two options: Specify the username and password to access the mailbox. UPDATE October 1, 2022 – This method is now deprecated by Microsoft and Graph API is the preferred option. Enable Microsoft Graph API access so that Crow Canyon App can access the mailbox using OAuth. This article describes the steps to configure Graph API access for Email Sync. Before granting permissions, follow below steps so that API will have access only to the required mailboxes. Steps to grant permissions only to required mailboxes Performing these steps will ensure that Crow Canyon Email API will never have access to all mailboxes in your tenancy. API permission restrictions to specific mailboxes is done before granting permissions to the API. API permissions can be scoped to specific mailboxes as per instructions in this Microsoft article. AppId to be used for this is “1c4f8870-3aab-4882-a733-f05081a17655”. Steps are also given below. Create a mail enabled group in your O365 admin center . Note that this steps requires administrator privileges on your O365 subscription. E.g. “ CrowCanyonEmailAPIAccess ” Add the required mailboxes (one or more) to this group Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell. For details, see Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell Run below command, note that changes to application access policies can take up to 30 minutes. Replace CrowCanyonEmailAPIAccess@yourdomain.com below with the email Id of the group created above: New-ApplicationAccessPolicy -AppId 1c4f8870-3aab-4882-a733-f05081a17655 -PolicyScopeGroupId CrowCanyonEmailAPIAccess@yourdomain.com -AccessRight RestrictAccess -Description \"Restrict Crow Canyon Email API app access to members of distribution group CrowCanyonEmailAPIAccess.\" Verify that mailbox accounts added to the group can be accessed by Graph API. Replace <mailbox email> below with email Id of the mailbox: Test-ApplicationAccessPolicy -Identity <mailbox email> -AppId 1c4f8870-3aab-4882-a733-f05081a17655 Verify that any other mailbox account that is not in “ CrowCanyonEmailAPIAccess ” group cannot be accessed by Graph API. Replace <mailbox email> below with email of mailbox that is not in the group: Test-ApplicationAccessPolicy -Identity <mailbox email> -AppId 1c4f8870-3aab-4882-a733-f05081a17655 Steps to grant permissions 1. Navigate to Email Sync app 2. Create a new configuration or edit an existing one for which API access is to be configured 3. Select “Microsoft Graph API Access” in “Connection Settings for Microsoft Exchange Server” in Email Sync as shown below: 4. Click ‘Grant Access’ in “Connection Settings for Microsoft Exchange Server” section to allow API access to mailboxes. 5. “Grant permissions” link will open a pop-up. Please use an account with admin privileges to grant the required permissions. Click “Accept” button to grant permissions. Note that the grant permissions dialog may still say that grant permissions to all mailboxes, but API is already restricted to only the mail enabled security group configured above. 6. Click ‘Test Connection’ to verify the access. Please wait for few minutes and try again if it doesn’t work immediately after granting the permissions: Note: If permissions are not granted, test connection will result in following error: 7. Save the configuration and wait for about 15 minutes. Send a mail to verify that Email Sync is working. Note that only new emails will be moved to SharePoint, existing emails prior to the configurations are not moved 8. Existing configurations that are using mailbox credentials can be moved to new Graph API based access by editing the configuration About Prakash Arya View all posts by Prakash Arya → © 2025 Crow Canyon Systems, Inc.

    "text": " Insert and Update records in External data source using NITRO Insert and Update records in External data source using NITRO 2083 views 2 min , 38 sec read 0 Applies To: SharePoint Online and On-Premises Description NITRO Forms allow integration of external data with SharePoint list data. Please refer this article for more details on various scenarios of fetching external data and populating in NITRO Forms. We can also write (insert / update) records in SQL server tables using NITRO Forms and Custom Actions. These operations work independently of fetch operations and need to be configured separately. Detailed Instructions Crow Canyon provides an API to perform the write operations Write operation requires connection string to the SQL server and parameters for the data to write We can use JavaScript action in Custom Actions and NITRO forms to invoke this API. API will invoke a stored procedure in DB to do the required update In this article, we take an example to update the status of the employee record in database. NITRO forms are configured to fetch “Employee” data from the database table. This is done using External Data column configurations (refer this article ). Summary of steps Create a stored procedure in database for the write operation Prepare JavaScript: Specify the connection string Specify the parameter values to call the stored procedure NITRO Configurations to update employee record Custom Action Forms 1. Create a stored procedure in database Create a stored procedure in database to update the record as per your requirement. Sample given below updates Employee Status based on the Employee Id. Sample stored procedure: USE [DataBaseName] GO / Object: StoredProcedure [dbo].[CCS_UpdateStatus] / SET ANSI_NULLS ON GO SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON GO CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[CCS_UpdateStatus] -- Add the parameters for the stored procedure here @EmpID int, @Status nvarchar(128) AS BEGIN -- SET NOCOUNT ON added to prevent extra result sets from -- interfering with SELECT statements. SET NOCOUNT ON; -- Insert statements for procedure here update [ExData_tblEmployee] set [Status] = @Status Where ID = @EmpId END GO 2. Prepare JavaScript In below script, modify the connection string and stored procedure name. Also pass the values for the parameters used in above stored procedure. Below script is different for SharePoint online and On-Premises. Based on your environment, choose the appropriate script. Sample JavaScript for SharePoint Online var serviceURL = \"https://crowcanyonapps.azurewebsites.net/api/DatabaseUtils\"; var ccWebServiceCall = function (serviceURL, parameters, funcCallback) { var reqdata = parameters; $.ajax({ type: \"POST\", url: serviceURL, data: JSON.stringify(reqdata), headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"text/json\" }, success: function (data) { if (data.Error) { //Error funcCallback(true, data.Error); } else { funcCallback(false, data); } }, error: function (data) { if (data.responseJSON && data.responseJSON.error && data.responseJSON.error.message && data.responseJSON.error.message.value) { funcCallback(true, 'Error Details: \"' + data.responseJSON.error.message.value + '\"'); } else { funcCallback(true, 'Error: \"' + data.statusText + '\", Details: \"' + data.responseText + '\"'); } } }); }; var objApiParams = { \"name\": \"UpdateQuery\", \"parameters\": { \"dbConn\": \"Server= ServerName; Database=Database Name;User ID=UserId;Password=Password;Encrypt=True;Connection Timeout=30\", \"queryText\": \"CCS_UpdateStatus\", \"isSProc\": true, \"params\": {} } }; objApiParams.parameters.params[\"EmpID\"] = currentItem.get_item(\"EmployeeId\"); objApiParams.parameters.params[\"Status\"] = \"Inactive\"; ccWebServiceCall(serviceURL, objApiParams, functionCallback); In the above script, “EmployeeId” is the SharePoint column which stores unique value of the database record. Sample JavaScript for SharePoint On-Premises Make the same changes as described above for On-premises as well. Script: var serviceURL = _spPageContextInfo.webAbsoluteUrl + \"/_layouts/15/CrowCanyon.CommonUtils/SPDataHandler\" + (_spPageContextInfo.siteClientTag.split(\"$$\")[1].split(\".\")[0] == \"16\" ? \"16\" : \"\") + \".aspx/DatabaseUtils\"; var ccWebServiceCall = function (serviceURL, parameters, funcCallback) { var reqdata = { methodInfo: parameters }; $.ajax({ type: \"POST\", url: serviceURL, data: JSON.stringify(reqdata), contentType: \"application/json; charset=utf-8\", headers: { \"Accept\": \"application/json; odata=verbose\" }, dataType: \"json\", success: function (res) { var data = res.d; if (data.Error) { //Error funcCallback(true, data.Error); } else { funcCallback(false, data); } }, error: function (data) { if (data.responseJSON && data.responseJSON.error && data.responseJSON.error.message && data.responseJSON.error.message.value) { funcCallback(true, 'Error Details: \"' + data.responseJSON.error.message.value + '\"'); } else { funcCallback(true, 'Error: \"' + data.statusText + '\", Details: \"' + data.responseText + '\"'); } } }); }; var objApiParams = { \"name\": \"UpdateQuery\", \"parameter"

Add mappings of old to new site URLs Example: Old Web URL: https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/NITRO/IT New Web URL: https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/NITRO/helpdesk Note: If you only want to run NITRO Repair for the site and there is no change in site URL, then you can leave this section blank. 4. This will re-install the NITRO and update the URL’s in the NITRO settings files. Please note that this step will also update the NITRO Studio in the site to the latest version. 5. Please wait until the process completes. Once done, it will show link to a page that has additional steps for URL change scenario. Note that this is not required if you are only running NITRO Repair for the site and there is no URL change. Step 2 – Update NITRO Configurations from NITRO URL Change page After above step, “Update NITRO Apps for site URL change” page will be opened automatically. You can also navigate to this page by clicking “this page” link as shown below: Click “Repair” button for “Custom Actions”, “Email Manager”, “Conditional Formatting”, “Linked Items” and “NITRO Forms” as shown below. These steps will do the additional updates required for these NITRO components. Step 3 – Manual Steps There are some manual steps required after doing the above updates. When NITRO components are added to pages in site, URL is referenced in code added to page. For some components this is updated automatically but for others few manual steps are needed as listed below. Component SharePoint On-Premises SharePoint Online – Classic UI SharePoint Online – Modern UI NITRO Reports No changes are required Update the URL in the Crow Canyon NITRO Report web parts in the pages. Go to all the pages in site where NITRO Reports are added -> Edit the Page -> Edit the web part and modify the URL with new URL as shown below: Note: In the content link, only modify the part of URL that has changed. Keep rest of the URL same as earlier. No changes are required Advanced Lookup No changes are required Note: This change is required only if you are using Standard SharePoint List Forms for a list. This is not required if you are using NITRO Forms. Go to the list where advanced lookup settings are configured ->Edit default SharePoint New and Edit forms from the list ribbon -> Edit the web part “(Hidden)CCSAdvancedLookupContentEditor” and modify the URL which is changed in the content link.

For more details regarding validations, please refer this article . Use Case 1 Configure validation on a date column so that entered date should be at least 14 days from today. In this example we have considered ‘Due Date’ column in Tickets list. Go to Site Contents -> Tickets -> List Settings -> Crow Canyon NITRO Forms -> Select “Due Date” column -> Column Settings panel (on the right) -> Add Validation. Select ‘Script’ option and configure the custom script given below. Script: var minDate = new Date(); minDate.setDate(minDate.getDate() + 14); var DueDate = new Date(objData.ColumnValue); if(minDate > DueDate){ objData.Status = false; objData.Message = \"Due Date cannot be less than 14 days from today\"; } return objData; Sample Output: Use Case 2 Configure validation on Due Date column based on Priority column. Priority Column value Validation High Due Date < Today + 7 (Due Date should not be beyond 7 days from Today) Other Due Date < Today + 14 (Due Date should not be beyond 14 days from Today) Go to Tickets -> List Settings -> Crow Canyon NITRO Forms -> Due Date column and configure the validation as shown below. Go to Site Contents -> Tickets -> List Settings -> Crow Canyon NITRO Forms -> Select “Due Date” column -> Column Settings panel (on the right) -> Add Validation. Script: var DueDate = new Date(objData.ColumnValue); var Priority = objData.FormContext.fetchColumnValueUI(\"Priority1\"); if(Priority == \"High\") { var maxDate = new Date(); maxDate.setDate(maxDate.getDate() + 7); if(maxDate < DueDate) { objData.Status = false; objData.Message = \"Due Date should be less than 7 days from today for high priority Tickets\"; } } if(Priority != \"High\") { var maxDate = new Date(); maxDate.setDate(maxDate.getDate() + 14); if(maxDate < DueDate) { objData.Status = false; objData.Message = \"Due Date can be less than 14 days from today\"; } } return objData; In the above script, replace “Priority1” column with internal name of the column as per our requirement.

It has multiple steps involved and this article has outlined the high level steps. We can assist in converting your classic site to modern site as part of professional services. Please contact sales@crowncanyon.com for more details. Steps Switch the default experience of all lists in the classic site to modern Refer this article for steps Publish NITRO Forms in “Modern” form experience. Go to the list that has NITRO Form configured, go to list settings, open “Crow Canyon NITRO Forms”, click “Manage Forms” in ribbon, choose “Modern” under “Form Experience”, click close and then Publish the form. Repeat this for all lists that have the NITRO Forms already configured. Branding Remove the classic branding and apply modern branding Steps to remove classic branding : Go to Site settings, open “Crow Canyon Branding (Classic sites)”, go to “General Settings”, disable “Crow Canyon Application Administration” and click apply. Next go to “Remove Branding” tab and click on “Revert” button. Steps to apply modern branding: Go to Site settings, open “Crow Canyon Branding (Modern sites)”, configure as needed and save. Workspaces Any web part page that is configured in the site needs to be recreated as Site Page and reconfigure the components of that page with modern web parts. For example, in Crow Canyon applications like IT/Facilities/Requests Management/etc. classic application sites we have “Workspaces” document library that has different pages configured with list views, reports etc. All these pages need to be recreated. Also, we have another library “Administration”, all the pages in this library also need to be recreated. Quick Launch/Top Link Bar If there are any classic page URLs used in quick launch/top link bar links, replace them with corresponding modern page URLs. Steps : Go to site settings, open “quick launch”/”Top link bar” (“Navigation” if publishing feature is activated) and reconfigure the links as required. Portal Leave the current classic potral as it is. Create new modern Portal using Crow Canyon NITRO Studio. Once the modern portal is ready, update the quick launch/top link bar links in main site. Please note that this will require additional license, please contact sales@crowcanyon.com for additional license. Disclaimer: Microsoft SharePoint modern experience is not supported for the “Tasks” list type so we have to keep using classic experience for this list type. We have seen some issues like “Title” column shows some strange value in modern view and downloads an invalid file when clicked instead of opening the form.

For any specific cases not covered directly by the configurations, custom JavaScript and CSS can be added. These custom scripts can be invoked on form load, on column values change and before/after item submit. For all these cases, scripts can be invoked conditionally based on values entered in the form. This article describes some sample use cases to configure form event actions in NITRO forms. Use Case 1 – Whenever value of a column changes, take part of the value entered in column and put it in another column As an example, we will read value from ‘Requester Email’ column in Tickets list and take first six characters and put it in another column ‘Email Name’. As per your use case you can use different columns and update the script to extract the required value. Detailed Steps Go to Ticket list -> List Settings -> Crow Canyon NITRO Forms -> Advanced section in left panel -> Form Event Actions and configure new form event action as shown below. Configure Update Form Controls as shown below: Script: var str = _ccs_FormUI.fetchColumnValueUI(\"RequesterEmail\"); if (str && str.length >= 6) {    return str.substring(0, 6); } else if (str) {    return str; } return ‘’; Note: In the above script replace “RequesterEmail” with internal name of the required column on which you want to configure this action. To know the internal name of the column, go to list settings -> Edit the required column -> Get the internal name of the URL in the browser as shown below. Sample Output Use Case 2 – Concatenate values in two columns using Form Event Actions We have taken example to concatenate ‘First Name’ and ‘Last Name’ column values and put the concatenated value in ‘Full Name’ column using form event actions. Detailed Steps Navigate to Crow Canyon NITRO Forms designer for the list -> Form Event Actions (in ‘Advanced’ section) and configure as shown below: Script: var FirstName = _ccs_FormUI.fetchColumnValueUI(\"FirstName\"); var LastName = _ccs_FormUI.fetchColumnValueUI(\"LastName\"); if(FirstName && LastName){ return FirstName+\" \"+LastName; } else if(FirstName) { return FirstName; } else if (LastName) { return LastName; } else { return \"\"; } In above script, replace ‘FirstName’ and ‘LastName’ with internal names of the respective columns. Sample Output Use Case 3 – Show/Hide ‘Edit’ button dynamically in item display form In this sample use case, we have configured form event action to show/hide ‘Edit’ button dynamically in item display form. In this example, ‘Edit’ button will be hidden when ‘Status’ is done, otherwise, it will be visible. Detailed Steps 1. Configure form event action as shown below. Below action will be executed in display form when status is ‘done’. Navigate to Crow Canyon NITRO Forms designer for the list -> Form Event Actions (in ‘Advanced’ section) and configure form event action as shown below: Configure ‘Execute Script’ action with the below script. Script: setTimeout(function(){$(\"#btnEdit\").hide(); $('[buttontype=\"edit\"]').parent().hide(); }, 100); Sample Output: Use Case 4 – Open the edit form of lookup item Sample list schema and use case Standard SharePoint list. ‘Category’: Single selection enabled NITRO lookup column ‘Edit’ link will open edit form of selected category in new tab. Steps to configure Add ‘Line/HTML’ control below the lookup column. Navigate to Crow Canyon NITRO Forms designer for the list -> Add ‘Line/HTML’ control (under ‘Form Controls’ section) below the lookup column. 2. Update the ‘Line/HTML’ control code with below script in ‘Line/HTML Settings’. Script: <div align=\"right\" id=\"editCategory\" style=\"padding-right:10px;\"></div> 3. Configure form event actions as shown below: Configure execute script action: Script: var CategoryID = _ccs_FormUI.fetchColumnValueForLookup(\"Category\"); if(CategoryID && CategoryID != 0){ var editLink = \"<a target='_blank' href='https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/helpdesk/it/SitePages/CCSEditForm.aspx?ListID=c5223fe0-157f-4729-8f22-9d68b8128bea&ItemID=\" + CategoryID +\"'>Edit</a>\"; $('#editCategory').html(editLink); } else{ $('#editCategory').html(\"\"); } functionCallback(); Note : Replace ‘Category’ with NITRO lookup column internal name. Replace the URL with lookup list edit form URL. Use Case 5 – Auto set default value for date column Sample list schema and use case Standard SharePoint list ‘Due Date’: Date column Auto set ‘Due Date’ column value seven days from today on form load Steps to configure 1. Navigate to Crow Canyon NITRO Forms designer for the list -> Form Event Actions (under Advanced section in left-hand panel)"

    "text": " NITRO Print – Advanced formatting using JavaScript NITRO Print – Advanced formatting using JavaScript 2608 views 3 min , 57 sec read 3 Applies To: SharePoint Online and On-premises NITRO activated sites Introduction NITRO Print supports standard print with table layout for list item columns. It also supports rich text based templates with column placeholders to create the required print format. For more information on rich text templates, please refer this article . Additionally, JavaScript can be used to format print content for advanced requirements. Print process follows this flow: Define the print template with required format in NITRO print app settings List Print (multiple items from the view) or Item print (single item) Table type or Rich text template Specify the JavaScript for custom formatting User invokes List or Item print in SharePoint UI NITRO print generates the printable content by using the template and replacing the column placeholders with data from the list item(s) NITRO print executes the custom JavaScript on generated printable content to get the final printable content User can directly print or generate PDF/image or send mail using the final content Configuration To configure custom JavaScript, navigate to list settings -> Crow Canyon Print Manager Settings -> Edit existing list/item print template or create new print template -> ‘Advanced’ tab -> Custom Script How to get column element in JavaScript Column placeholders in print template are replaced by column label and column value in printable content. Column element in HTML has a ‘name’ attribute with a specific syntax so that it can be queried easily in JavaScript. // Format for column name attribute value: ccs_control_<Column Internal Name>_<List Item Id> // Example HTML: <td style=\"width:82.2526%;\"> <span name=\"ccs_control_Priority1_1\">Normal</span> </td> Sample JavaScript code to get the HTML element of column label with internal name ‘Category1’: // get element for column with internal name Category1 var colElement = $('[name=\"ccs_control_Category1_' + objData.CurrentItem.get_id() +'\"]'); To get multiple column elements: var arrColumns = [\"Category1\",\"IssueType\",\"DueDate1\",\"Priority1\"]; for (var i = 0; i < arrColumns.length; i++) { var colElement = $('[name=\"ccs_control_'+arrColumns[i]+'_'+objData.CurrentItem.get_id()+'\"]'); // do something with column element } To get value of a column from item (not from HTML). The value can be used for some checks like in case of permissions check: // Use column internal name to get the value from the current item var columnValue = objData.CurrentItem.get_item(<Column Internal Name>); JavaScript Examples 1. Item Print: Remove column label from print content if column value is blank Some column values may be entered later in the business process. If item is printed before the values are filled, then column label will be in the print but not the value. One option is to have separate print templates for different stages. Instead of managing multiple templates, custom JavaScript can be used to remove rows of columns that do not yet have a value. In this example, script checks for value of ‘Category1’, ‘IssueType’, ‘DueDate1’ and ‘Priority1’ columns and removes the column row if column value is blank. Print Template: Custom Script: Script used in above: var arrColumns = [\"Category1\",\"IssueType\",\"DueDate1\",\"Priority1\"]; for (var i = 0; i < arrColumns.length; i++) { var ColumnValueElement = $('[name=\"ccs_control_'+arrColumns[i]+'_'+objData.CurrentItem.get_id()+'\"]'); if(ColumnValueElement.text().trim() == \"\"){ ColumnValueElement.parent().parent().hide(); } } functionCallback(); Note: In above script modify the column internal names as per columns in your list 2. Item Print: Show multi-choice column as check boxes Multi-choice column has the text of selected options and that is what gets printed by default. Options that are not selected are not shown in print. Frequently it is required to print these as check boxes with selected values as checked, same way as it appears on NITRO Forms. Below example script changes the print content of a multi-choice column with name ‘Tags’ by replacing the text value with check boxes. Script used in above: var columnInternalName = \"Tags\"; // get column choice options var arrAllPossibleValues = objData.Dic_ListColumns[columnInternalName].Choices.results; // get column value in current item var columnValue = objData.CurrentItem.get_item(columnInternalName); // build check boxes html based on options and column value var buildColumnValue = \"\"; for (var i = 0; i < arrAllPossibleValues.length; i++) { var val = arrAllPossibleValues[i]; var selectedText = \"\"; if (columnValue && columnValue.indexOf(val) >= 0) { // Check the box if value is in item, otherwise not selectedText = 'checked=\"checked\"'; } buildColumnValue += '<div><input disabled=\"disabled\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"' + val + '\" ' + selectedText + '><label>' + val + '</label></div>'; } // Get column value documen"

Crow Canyon NITRO Studio components can connect to REST based APIs to fetch and update the data in external systems. REST integration can be added in following components: NITRO Custom Actions: Call REST APIs with and without authentication to fetch/update data in external systems NITRO Workflows: Call REST APIs with and without authentication to fetch/update data in external systems NITRO Forms: Using custom JavaScript option, invoke the required REST API and process the response. Response can be used to populate data on the form or update data in SharePoint list items Web service call can be used to create/update records in external system. Or the response returned by the web service can be used to create/update records in SharePoint (list items). Note: This document shows images from NITRO Custom Actions. Functionality is mostly similar in NITRO Workflows and document mentions wherever there is any difference.  ‘Invoke Web Service’ feature in NITRO Workflows and Custom Actions Call web services requiring different types of authentication Insert/Update data in external systems as per the business flow in SharePoint. E.g., if Purchase Order is created in SharePoint application, then create/update a record in Salesforce Fetch data from external system and create/update records in SharePoint. For e.g., fetch details corresponding to a Purchase Order in SharePoint and update its status as per the value in external system. If response contains multiple records, then those can be created in SharePoint as separate list items with mapping of response elements to SharePoint list columns Placeholder support in URL, headers and data of the request. These placeholders are replaced with actual values from the SharePoint item at the time of execution Sensitive information like username, password, client secret etc. is encrypted using AES encryption and is never available in client side as plain text. For OAuth 2.0 authentication, initial call to get access token is made from server side only so that Client Id and Client Secret are never accessible to end users on client side For custom authentication scenarios, request to get access token can be done as a separate action. Pass the required data to the web service and obtain the access token. Then use this token as a placeholder in second call to perform the required web service operation Pre-requisites to configuring web service action in NITRO components URL of the web service Authentication mechanism and corresponding details like username and password for basic authentication and Client Id/Secret etc. for Auth 2.0 Headers required by the API (e.g. ‘Accept’ header with value ‘application/json;odata=verbose’) Request body syntax Mapping of placeholders of SharePoint data to URL, Headers, Body and Authentication settings Cross-origin HTTP requests are permitted for your scenario. That is, your API supports calls from SharePoint pages if using client-side execution. Refer this article for more details Ensure that HTTP Request can be made from the postman application with above details Structure of the response and how to map it to SharePoint for insert/update If REST service call is done from SharePoint pages (NITRO Forms and client-side option in Custom Actions), only https services can be invoked. If REST is invoked from server side (NITRO Workflows and server-side option in Custom Actions), both http and https services can be invoked Invoke Web Service Action Web Service Settings Execute on Client: HTTP request will be made using JavaScript code running in the browser.

This article lists some of the use cases for common steps in NITRO Apps configurations: How to navigate to list settings page How to get the internal name of a list column How to get the Id of a SharePoint list How to enable version history for list How to open list forms in a dialog How to create a column with internal name How to navigate to list settings page To navigate to the list settings page, please go to Site Contents -> Navigate to the required list -> List settings from the list ribbon. How to get the internal name of a list column To get internal name of the column, please go to Site Contents -> Navigate to the required list -> List Settings -> Crow Canyon NITRO Forms -> Select the required column on the form and find the column internal name in column settings Alternatively, go to the list settings -> Edit the column and find the internal name of the column at the end of the URL in the browser. How to get the Id of a SharePoint list To know the SharePoint list ID, please go to Site Contents -> Navigate to the required list -> List settings and find the list Id at the end of the URL. How to enable version history for list The SharePoint Version History feature makes it possible to see and restore earlier version of list items. To enable version history, please go to Site Contents -> Navigate to the required list -> List settings -> Versioning settings under General settings and enable item version history. How to open list forms in a dialog SharePoint list forms (new, edit and display) can be opened in a dialog box instead of navigating to the full page. Please go to Site Contents -> Navigate to the required list -> List settings -> Advanced settings under General settings and enable Launch forms in a dialog. How to create a column with specific internal name SharePoint list columns have a display name and an internal name. Once created, display name can be changed but internal name is not editable. SharePoint automatically generates internal name of the column from its display name. Internal name cannot have spaces and special characters so it can be different from display name. For example, if we create a column with name ‘Task Status’, SharePoint will generate its internal name as ‘Task_x0020_Status’. Here space is replaced with equivalent Unicode character value. To create a column with specific internal name, during column creation we need to specify the display name without any special characters and whitespace characters. For example, in this case we will create the column with display name as ‘TaskStatus’. After creating the column, we can edit the column from list settings page and modify the display name (‘Task Status’).

How to configure Teams connection in NITRO? 2082 views 1 min , 53 sec read 0 Applies To Crow Canyon NITRO activated sites in SharePoint Online Description Crow Canyon NITRO components like Bots, Workflows and Custom Actions can connect to Microsoft Teams for various operations. For these operations NITRO components need to connect to Teams and this article describes the steps for the same. There are two options for Teams connection: Crow Canyon Teams API : This API is created by Crow Canyon and you can grant the required permissions so that it can be used by NITRO components. This API is only used for Teams operations configured in NITRO components in your SharePoint sites and not used in any other way Custom API : If you cannot use Crow Canyon Teams API then you can create your own Azure AD app with required permissions. You can refer Microsoft documentation for creating the app. Crow Canyon can also assist in this process as part of professional services. After creating the app note the required information like Id and secret and configure it as described below Currently supported operations for Microsoft Teams from NITRO components are given below: Send an adaptive card to: Notify user with custom message having placeholders from SharePoint list item Update an item Invoke a NITRO Workflow Create a new channel under an existing Team Send an email message to a channel Post a message to a channel Note that new operations for Teams are being added to NITRO components continuously. Detailed Steps Setup Teams connection in NITRO Navigate to Site Settings -> Crow Canyon NITRO Site Settings. Under Site Administration -> expand ‘Teams Connection Settings’ section.

There is a separate settings file for each list. This file contains configurations for all the custom actions configured on that list. These files are stored in below locations: Site Assets -> CCS -> CustomActions Site Assets -> CCS -> Backup -> CustomActions Any update to custom action settings for a list creates a new version of the corresponding settings file in both ‘CustomActions’ and ‘Backup’ folder. ‘CustomActions’ folder: This is the primary location and Custom Actions are executed as per configurations stored in this folder. A new version of settings file is created for every update to the custom actions. That is, when an action is added, updated, or deleted for a list, file corresponding to that list is modified and that creates a new version of that file. ‘Backup\\CustomActions’ folder: This folder is maintained as a backup of settings and is not actively used. Settings file for the list is updated in this folder on add or update of custom actions in the list. When an action is deleted, this file is not updated. It is possible to restore custom action settings from the file in either of the folders. This could be for a deleted action or a modification that needs to be undone. Backup folder is useful if the file in primary folder gets deleted by mistake resulting in loss of all versions. In this case, the settings can be downloaded from backup folder and uploaded to primary folder. This article describes the steps to restore custom actions settings from these two folders. Detailed Steps In this article we have taken Tickets list as an example, same process can be applied to any list. Determine the Id of the list: Open the site in chrome browser -> go to Site Contents -> Tickets list -> List Settings -> Note the list Id in the URL. Restore settings from ‘CustomActions’ (primary) folder Navigate to the Custom Actions settings file folder: Go to site contents -> Site Assets document library -> CCS -> CustomActions -> Search for file with the list Id noted in above step. Restore the settings file version: – Click on the ECB (3 dots next to the file name as shown in UI below) to bring up the menu. – Click ‘Version History’ option -> Select the required version and click ‘Restore’ as shown below. Restore settings from ‘Backup\\CustomActions’ folder Navigate to the Custom Actions settings file in Backup folder: Go to site contents -> Site Assets document library -> CCS -> Backup -> CustomActions -> Search for file with the list Id noted in above step. Download the backup file from Backup folder: Upload the file to primary CustomActions folder: Navigate to Site Assets document library -> CCS -> CustomActions folder and upload the downloaded file in this folder.

Click corresponding Portal tile in NITRO Applications page, enter the required details as described below and click Ok. Parent Site:  Choose the site under which the Portal site needs to be created. Generally it will be the back-end site (i.e. Helpdesk application site). Site Title : Title for the new Portal site. This can be changed later from site settings if needed. Site Address : URL of the Portal site. We recommend to use alpha-numeric URL name without spaces. Please note that it requires several configuration changes if URL is to be changed later. Or site can be reinstalled with different URL. License Type : Choose the “Trial” and proceed with the installation. Once installation is done, contact Crow Canyon for permanent license. If no option is available under License Type, please contact Crow Canyon Support. Refer this  article  to convert the Crow Canyon NITRO Trial License to Subscription/Enterprise license. Reassign Owners Group Name : Specify the required SharePoint group. Members of this group will have the permissions for portal administration. Any SharePoint site is created with 3 default SharePoint groups (Owners, Members, Visitors) prefixed with the site name. We can use these groups or some other custom group name that can be created after site is created. IT Site URL: Select the back-end site URL (i.e. Helpdesk application site). Portal application will use the configurations from back-end site. Additional Configurations 1. Delete unique permissions for the site and configure the permissions as required. Go to Portal Site -> Portal Administration -> Security Settings -> click “Portal Permissions” and configure the permissions as required. 2. For Portal Classic applications: Navigate to below Administration page, by modifying the Portal Site URL in below.

This article describes below use cases to sort and filter values in the lookup columns:     Filter items in lookup dropdown by specifying the required view Show different sets of lookup items to end users (who use NITRO Portal site) and staff users (who use the NITRO forms in the main/backend site) Show different items in lookup column based on logged-in user In this article, we have taken example of ‘Issue Type’ lookup column in Tickets list. Use Case 1: Filter items in lookup dropdown by specifying the required view It is likely that over time certain items in lookup list get deprecated and should no longer be selected as lookup values in new items. However, they should continue to be valid for existing items. In this case, we can create a new column in lookup list to indicate if the item is active or deprecated. Based on this column a view can be created to list only the active items. This view can then be used in NITRO Forms lookup column configurations to show only active items in the dropdown of the lookup column. To filter lookup items in forms, first we can create a view with required filter conditions and then use the view in lookup column settings as shown below: In below use case, Issue Type lookup column will show all the items that are in ‘Active Items’ view. Use Case 2: Show different set of lookup items to end users and staff NITRO applications typically have two sites. Backend site for the staff users and the simplified portal site for the end users. In some cases, it is required to show a limited set of Issue Types to end users in portal site. Staff users in backend sites should see all issue types. We can configure this by creating different views for Staff and End Users in the lookup list (In this case ‘Issue Type’ list). Create a column ‘Type of Users’ in Issue Type list (i.e. in lookup list) Column Internal Name: TypeofUsers Column Display Name: Type of Users Column Type: Choice (Multi-Checkbox) Options: Staff End Users Create filtered views for Staff and End Users based on ‘Type of Users’ column. Below filtered view will show all the Issue Types where ‘Type of Users’ column value is equal to ‘Staff’. Similarly, we can create other views. Configure filtered views in backend site and portal site. Backend Site: Navigate to NITRO forms -> Edit Issue Type lookup column settings and configure ‘Staff’ view in lookup settings as shown below: Portal Site: Go to Portal site -> Portal Settings -> Portal Forms -> Edit Tickets list forms and configure ‘End Users’ view in lookup settings as shown below: Use Case 3: Show different items in lookup column based on logged-in user In some cases, it is required to filter items in lookup dropdown based on logged in user. This can be done using SharePoint item level permissions. SharePoint list items can be permissioned individually. Based on logged-in user, lookup drop-down will show only those items that user has access to. For more on item level permissions, please refer SharePoint documentation. With NITRO Workflows, item level permissions can be assigned to items based on the required business scenario. Please refer this article for more details. For sample configurations, refer this FAQ .

This will be applicable to both NITRO Studio activated sites and NITRO pre-built application sites. Summary of Steps Pre-requisites Backup and Restore Activate NITRO Studio and Apply License Post Configurations Detailed Steps Pre-Requisites We need to ensure all the Crow Canyon Solutions are already deployed in the target SharePoint environment prior to the restore process. Install Crow Canyon NITRO Studio solutions (CrowCanyon.NITROStudio.wsp, CrowCanyon.WorkflowManager.wsp and CrowCanyon.CommonUtils.wsp) in target SharePoint on-premises environment. If the web application has one of the below Crow Canyon pre-built applications then we need install two additional solutions (CCSSRWorkflows.wsp and CrowCanyon.TimerJobs.wsp) Pre-built Crow Canyon Applications IT Help Desk Facilities Management Request Management Customer Service Asset Management Equipment Management If source environment is using NITRO Secure version: Refer https://www.crowcanyon.help/article/617 to install Crow Canyon NITRO Studio Secure. If source environment is using NITRO Studio version: Refer https://www.crowcanyon.help/article/448 to install Crow Canyon NITRO Studio. Note: This step needs to be performed before the restore operation.

During this Ticket update operation, ‘Modified By’ column is set to ‘SharePoint app’. In some cases, it is required to capture the logged-in user who closed the Ticket. In Crow Canyon Service Request application, Ticket can be closed in two ways: Ticket closed directly from the edit form Use ‘Close’ custom action in Tickets list This article describes steps to capture the user who closed the Ticket for both cases. Detailed Steps Create a ‘Person or Group’ column and add it to NITRO Forms Navigate to NITRO Forms of Tickets list -> ‘Create Column’. Create a ‘Person or Group’ column ‘ClosedBy’. Add ‘ClosedBy’ column in the form from ‘Form Controls’ section (in left-hand panel). Edit the column settings and modify its name from ‘ClosedBy’ to ‘Closed By’. We can configure permissions on ‘Closed By’ column to make it read-only or hidden as required. Since this column value will be set automatically, users do not need to update value. Please refer this article for permissions configuration details. Case 1: Ticket closed directly from the edit form In this case, ‘Closed By’ is set using Form Event Actions whenever the ‘Request Status’ column value is changed to ‘Closed’. Navigate to ‘Form Event Actions’ under Advanced section and configure as shown below: Please refer this article for Form Event Action configuration details. Case 2: Ticket closed using ‘Close’ custom action Ticket can be closed using ‘Close’ custom action. This action is available in Tickets display form. To capture the actual user in ‘Closed By’ column, add column mapping in ‘Close’ custom action. Navigate to Crow Canyon Custom Actions -> Edit ‘Close’ custom action.

NITRO Secure solution works entirely from within your SharePoint network and does not need to connect to Crow Canyon services running in Azure. Also, all file references (JavaScript, CSS etc.) are local to site collection and not from Crow Canyon CDN. NITRO updates are applied manually giving more control to administrators to decide when to apply updates and to which site collections. If you are looking for NITRO Secure, please contact Crow Canyon sales or support team for the installation package. Prerequisites SharePoint should be installed and configured (SharePoint 2019 and SharePoint SE) and server should be in stable state. App Catalog To install Crow Canyon Modern UI apps, Administrator should create app catalog site for the web application. Note: Please refer below article to install and manage apps in SharePoint server URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/administration/install-and-manage-apps-for-sharepoint-server Site collection To install in a new site collection, administrator should create a new site collection with team site template. Or installation can be done in an existing site collection created with team site template. To install/upgrade SharePoint wsp solutions, logged in user account should have following privileges: Domain user Local administrator SharePoint farm administrator Owner rights on SharePoint configuration database, central administration content database and web application content database User should have site collection administrator rights on the site collection User should have full control permissions on the app catalog site Microsoft .NET Framework 4.7.2 or above should be installed on the SharePoint server. Make sure that SharePoint administration and SharePoint timer services are running in all servers in the farm. Install Package NITRO Secure installation package contains one file “NITROStudioSetup.msi”. Summary of Steps Extract and run NITROStudioSetup.msi Run Crow Canyon NITRO Studio Helper Install Modern UI Apps Install NITRO Secure in the Site collection Activate NITRO Secure for a site Register License Install NITRO Workflow debugging service Install NITRO Office API for document generation Detailed Steps Extract and run NITROStudioSetup.msi Copy the downloaded “NITROStudioSetup.zip” file to the SharePoint Server. Note: If there are multiple SharePoint servers in the farm, copy the “NITROStudioSetup.zip” file to one of the servers in the SharePoint farm that is running “Microsoft SharePoint Foundation Web Application” service. Open Command Prompt (Run as Administrator) –> navigate to the Package location –> enter the below command to verify MD5 signature for the package. CertUtil -hashfile NITROStudioSetup.zip MD5 In this example, package download link is like “https://…/MD5_de609b2210c24edd9d40b691613a7574/NITROStudioSetup.zip” and the command output is matching with checksum in the download link as expected. Please contact sharepointsupport@crowcanyon.com if this checksum is not matching. Note : MD5 signature is to be verified for the downloaded ‘NITROStudioSetup.zip’ file and not the ‘NITROStudioSetup.msi’ file extracted from the zip file. After MD5 signature is validated, right click on zip file and extract ‘NITROStudioSetup.msi’ file. Copy “NITROStudioSetup.msi” installer to your SharePoint server. Right click on the file, open properties panel, and click on ‘Unblock’ button if it is there.

Predefined patterns include validating format for phone number, email, and number. For any custom patterns, regular expression can be used for validation. This article lists sample use cases for regular expression-based validations. Use Case 1 Configure validation such that specified value in the single line of text column should not have space(s) at the end of line. In this sample, validation is configured on ‘Employee Name’ column. This is a single line of text column; validation will also work on multiple lines of plain text column. Navigate to NITRO Forms designer settings. Go to List -> List Settings -> Crow Canyon NITRO Forms -> Select the required column -> Expand ‘Validations’ section on the right -> Click ‘Add’ button to configure a new validation. Configure the column validation as shown below: Note that validation type is ‘Pattern’ and pattern value is ‘Custom’. Regular expression used in ‘Validation Value’ is [^\\s]+$ After configuring this validation, publish the NITRO Forms. Sample output Use Case 2 Configure validation such that the entered email address in single line of text column should be of a specific domain. Email addresses are validated on the bases of specific but case insensitive domain. In this sample, validation is configured on ‘Email Address’ column. Only the first email address specified in this single line of text column is validated. Navigate to NITRO Forms designer for the list. Go to the list -> List Settings -> Crow Canyon NITRO Forms -> Select the required column -> Expand ‘Validations’ section on the right -> Click ‘Add’ button to configure a new validation. Configure column validation as shown below: Click ‘Edit’ button to specify custom script. Script: var reExpr = new RegExp(/((\\w+).?)+@contoso\\.com/i); objData.Status = reExpr.test(objData.ColumnValue); if(!objData.Status){ objData.Message = \"This domain is not allowed\"; } return objData; Note: Replace ‘contoso’ with required domain. Replace ‘This domain is not allowed’ with required validation message. After configuring this validation, publish the NITRO Forms. Sample output Use Case 3 Configure validation such that specified value in a column should not have any special characters. Navigate to NITRO Forms designer settings. Go to List -> List Settings -> Crow Canyon NITRO Forms -> Select the required column -> Expand ‘Validations’ section on the right -> Click ‘Add’ button to configure a new validation. Configure the column validation as shown below: Note that validation type is ‘Pattern’ and pattern value is ‘Custom’. Regular expression used in ‘Validation Value’ is ^[a-zA-Z0-9-\\s]*$ Above regular expression allows alpha numeric characters, space and hyphen. Regular expression can be modified as needed. After configuring this validation, publish the NITRO Forms. Sample output About supportTeam View all posts by supportTeam → © 2025 Crow Canyon Systems, Inc.

Regular version (Azure) connects to Crow Canyon components hosted in Microsoft Azure. This includes checks for licensing and referring JavaScript and CSS files. Note that no SharePoint data is sent outside of customer network. NITRO Secure version (Non-Azure) does not refer to any component outside of customer network and everything is installed within the SharePoint farm. This document has steps to move from Azure version to Non-Azure version. It is possible to have some sites on Azure version while transitioning to Non-Azure versions so both can co-exist. However, it is recommended to move all sites in the farm to same version for ease of maintenance and support. NITRO Secure Installation Refer instructions to install NITRO Secure from this article NITRO Secure Conversion Open “Crow Canyon NITRO Studio Helper” shortcut from the desktop and click “Show all sites status” link in the NITRO Secure utility tool as shown below: This will open a page that shows status of NITRO activation for all the sites in the SharePoint farm. User should have the required privileges to see status for all sites. NITRO Studio status page: Activate NITRO Studio Activate NITRO Studio for the site where NITRO Studio Azure is originally activated. Note that after NITRO Secure installation, ‘Activate’ button will be shown for the site instead of ‘Manage’ button. And NITRO has to be re-activated on the site. Navigate to the site collection where NITRO Secure is installed and click gear icon (cog) in the top right corner as shown below: refer “Activate NITRO for a site” section in this article to activate NITRO Studio for a site. Save NITRO components settings NITRO Apps configurations need to be resaved after activating the Non-Azure version in site. Go to site where NITRO Studio is activated -> Site settings -> Crow Canyon NITRO Apps -> navigate to each app listed below to save the configurations. Email Manager Select each list that is configured for this app and save settings. No changes are required in the settings, just open the settings, and save. NITRO Forms For every list that is using NITRO Forms, open the NITRO Forms designer and then publish NITRO forms. Advanced Lookup Save each configuration in Advanced Lookup settings page. Branding Remove branding and reapply the same branding: Remove branding: https://www.crowcanyon.info/nitro/appmanual_v2/index.html?removing-branding.html Apply branding: https://www.crowcanyon.info/nitro/appmanual_v2/index.html?crow-canyon-themes.html Cascaded Lookup Note: This step can be safely ignored if the lists are already using NITRO Forms. This is required only if there are some lists that use cascaded lookup feature on standard SharePoint forms (not NITRO Forms). 1.Remove “CCSCascadedLookupScriptWP” webpart from default new and edit forms (standard SharePoint list item forms). Go to the list that is using cascaded lookup settings -> List ribbon -> click on “Default New Form” as shown below, delete the web part names “CCSCascadedLookupScriptWP” and stop editing the page. Repeat the same for Default Edit Form. 2. After deleting the “CCSCascadedLookupScriptWP” webpart from both default New and Edit forms, go to the list settings -> Crow Canyon Cascaded Lookup -> Edit the cascaded lookup settings and save the settings. This step will add the web parts back with new references to forms. 3. Repeat the same for every list using cascaded lookup on SharePoint forms Custom Actions For each list having Custom Actions configured, navigate to Custom Actions for the list and resave each custom action.

    "text": " Sample use cases for Execute Script action in Crow Canyon Custom Actions Sample use cases for Execute Script action in Crow Canyon Custom Actions 1559 views 2 min , 12 sec read 0 Applies to: SharePoint Online and On-Premises Description NITRO Custom Actions have several built-in actions to implement business process automation. For example, actions to create, update, and delete SharePoint list items. Also, actions to query list items, generate document based on template and invoke a web service etc. For any custom functionality not covered directly by these actions, JavaScript code can be written as part of “Execute Script” action. This action provides access to SharePoint and NITRO APIs to implement custom business process. This article lists some of the use cases with detailed steps for Execute Script action: Generate a custom unique ID for SharePoint list items Download document generated using “Generate Document” action Set value for a variable in Execute Script action Detailed Description 1. Generate a custom unique ID for SharePoint list items Please refer this article for steps to generate custom unique ID for SharePoint list items. 2. Download document generated using “Generate Document” action Please refer this manual for usage of this action. In this sample use case, we have a Custom Action to generate Ticket information document using “Generate Document” action. This action uploads the document to the configured document library. With custom script we can auto-download this document after it is generated. This article assumes that file name has syntax like “<Ticket Title>_<Ticket ID>” example, “Printer is Not Working_12.docx” Instructions: Navigate to NITRO Custom Actions configured for the list. Edit the custom action that generates the required document. In this example we are editing ‘Generate Ticket Information’ custom action. Action 1: Generate Ticket Information Configure generate document action as shown below: Action 2: Open generated document Configure ‘Execute Script’ action to download the generated document as shown below: Below script builds the URL of the document using library URL, current item Title and ID. It will then open the document. Script: var currentItemId = currentItem.get_id(); var currentItemTitle = currentItem.get_item(\"Title\") window.open(\"https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/NITRO/ITProfessional/Documents/\" + currentItemTitle + \"_\" + currentItemId + \".docx\", \"_blank\"); functionCallback(); Note : Replace the URL with document library URL used in the generated document action Replace “.docx” as per the document template type In Google Chrome browser, if you get any popup-blockers, choose “Always allow..” option 3. Set value for Custom Action variable using Execute Script action Variables can be used in several places including conditions and column mappings in custom actions. For custom business logic, variable value can be accessed and updated in JavaScript. Variable can then be used in subsequent actions. In this sample use case, value of a variable is set in JavaScript based on some conditions and then it is used in create item action to set a column value of new item. So, depending on conditions, different value can be set. Custom action details: Action is configured in CRM application Action is triggered on ‘Lead’ item Its purpose is to create an ‘Opportunity’ item based on details in ‘Lead’ item Opportunity has a column for type of account and it can be: Partner: If lead indicates that it is for a potential partner Customer: For all other cases Custom action uses a variable ‘VarAccountType’ that is set to ‘Partner’ or ‘Customer’ depending on the value of “Potential Partner” column in the lead item ‘VarAccountType’ is then used in opportunity creation action to set value of account type column Instructions: ‘Generate Opportunity’ custom action configuration details are given below: Define variable: Action 1: Update Lead status to closed This action will update the “Lead Status” to “Closed”. Action 2: Set Account Type Script: var partner = currentItem.get_item(\"PotentialPartner\"); if(partner){ ccs_setwfvariablevalue(\"VarAccountType\", \"Partner\"); } else{ ccs_setwfvariablevalue(\"VarAccountType\", \"Customer\"); } functionCallback(); Note : In above script replace “PotentialPartner” with required column internal name. Note that we are using ccs_setwfvariablevalue function to set the value of variable. First parameter is the variable name and second parameter is the value to set for the variable. Action 3: Create Opportunity This action will create Opportunity for the Lead. ‘AccountType’ column value is set to variable value using expression: VarAccountType##Value About supportTeam View all posts by supportTeam → © 2025 Crow Canyon Systems, Inc.

For this, legacy authentication needs be enabled at tenancy level. As an alternative to legacy authentication, we can grant access using SharePoint app-only method described in this article. Pre-requisites Site Collection Administrator Summary of Steps Register new app Grant permissions to the registered app Detailed Steps Register new app Go to SitecollectionURL/_layouts/15/AppRegNew.aspx by using a web browser. SitecollectionURL: Target site collection that this application is supposed to access and perform required operations through the Crow Canyon service. Example: https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/nitro/_layouts/15/AppRegNew.aspx Enter values for the following form fields and then click “Create”. Client Id : Click “Generate” button and that will generate a unique value. Client Secret : Click “Generate” button and that will generate a unique value. Title : A user-friendly title; for example, Crow Canyon Data Sync Service. Users are prompted to grant or deny the add-in the permissions that the add-in is requesting. This title appears as the name of the add-in on the consent prompt. App Domain : Enter your tenant domain. Do not include protocol (“https:”) or “/” characters in this value. Please note that in the sample screenshot below, we use yourcompanyname as just example and do not use it as it is. Redirect URI : Enter redirect URL including the protocol, which must be HTTPS. Again, sample screenshot has just an example and do not use as it is. After we click “Create” button, it will show the summary of information as shown below. Important : Store the retrieved information (client id and client secret) since you’ll need this in the next step! 2. Grant permissions to the registered app Go to SiteCollectionUrl/_layouts/15/appinv.aspx. Once the page is loaded, enter client id generated in above step and click “Lookup” button. This will auto populate the title, app domain and redirect URL as shown below: To grant permissions, you’ll need to provide the permission XML that describes the needed permissions. For Crow Canyon services it needs below permissions: <AppPermissionRequests AllowAppOnlyPolicy=\"true\" > <AppPermissionRequest Scope=\"http://sharepoint/content/sitecollection\" Right=\"FullControl\" /> </AppPermissionRequests> When you click on Create you’ll be presented with a permission consent dialog. Press ‘Trust It’ to grant the permissions: About supportTeam View all posts by supportTeam → © 2025 Crow Canyon Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved Terms of Service Privacy Policy www.crowcanyon.com"

For example, ‘IT Portal (2020)’ is a portal application for IT applications, that refers to the backend site’s ‘Tickets’ list. Portal pages and webparts such as ‘View My Tickets’, ‘Quick Tickets’, etc. are configured based on this list. In some cases, it is required for the portal site to refer to additional lists along with the pre-defined list. This requires some modifications in the existing NITRO Portal application. This article has steps to achieve this functionality. In this sample use case, the ‘IT Portal (2020)’ application is modified to refer to the ‘Time Tracking’ list along with the existing Tickets list. The same steps can be followed to add other backend lists to the NITRO portal applications. Summary of steps Create NITRO forms for portal site Configure list views Add menu links Configurations in ‘Application Administration’ Detailed steps Create NITRO forms for portal site Navigate to the backend site -> ‘Site Contents’ -> ‘Time Tracking’ list -> ‘List Settings’ from ‘LIST’ ribbon -> Crow Canyon NITRO Forms. Create a new form for the portal site as needed. Note : If no changes are required on the item form for the portal site, then use the same form. Otherwise, create a new form. A new form is useful to show limited columns to the end user in the portal site. ‘PortalTimeTracking’ is the new form created for the portal site in this example. The buttons that are not required on the portal forms can be hidden from the ‘Layouts and Theme’ section (in left-hand panel) -> ‘Buttons’. Check the buttons that are not required on the form. Similarly, hide any custom actions that shouldn’t be visible to portal users. Configure override form settings. Click ‘Manage Forms’ from ‘FORM’ ribbon -> ‘Advanced Settings’ -> ‘Configure Override Forms’ settings for the backend site and the portal site. Syntax: ‘Source Form’ => ‘Target Form’  Override settings for back-end site : With this override settings, items created from ‘PortalTimeTracking’ form will open with ‘Time Tracking’ form in the backend site. Override settings for portal site: With these override settings, items created from ‘Time Tracking’ form will open with ‘PortalTimeTracking’ form in the portal site. Configure list views Navigate to the portal site -> ‘Portal Administration’ -> ‘Configure Apps and Pages’ -> List Views. Configure new list view for ‘Time Tracking’ list.  Specify back-end site URL. Specify ‘Page Actions’ as shown below: Add a new workspace page and add the configured list view web part to this page. For Classic UI Portal : Go to ‘Portal Administration’ -> ‘Configure Apps and Pages’ -> ‘Add Workspace Page’ and create new workspace page by specifying the name, layout and location as needed. Add the configured list view web part to this page from the Crow Canyon ‘List Views’ app. For Modern UI Portal : Add a new site page and add the configured list view web part to this page. Go to ‘Portal Administration’ -> ‘Configure Apps and Pages’ -> ‘Add Workspace Page’ and create a new site page by specifying the name. Add the configured list view web part to this page as shown below: Note : If the page needs to be edited after it is published, then append the page URL with ‘?CCSMode=1’ -> ‘Edit’ the page and add the webpart as shown above. Add menu links Note : URL is different for classic UI and modern UI. For modern UI, refer to ‘For Modern UI Portal’ section. For Classic UI Portal: Submit New Item: Modify the URL as shown below: URL:  ##Portal Site URL##/CrowCanyonAppsLib/AdvForms/CCSNewForm.aspx?&FormKey=##Portal Form Key##&WebURL=##Backend site URL##&ListID={##List ID##} Example: https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/helpdesk/IT/Portal/CrowCanyonAppsLib/AdvForms/CCSNewForm.aspx?&FormKey=PortalTicket&WebURL=https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/helpdesk/IT&ListID={bf3c153c-c8bb-482f-841d-047e875b64ee} In the above URL, replace placeholders as described below: Placeholder Value ##Portal Site URL## Specify portal site URL ##Portal Form Key## Specify form key of newly created form in backend site ##Backend site URL## Specify technician site URL ##List ID## Specify list Id View Time Tracking: Copy the URL of the workspace page created in #2.

For any specific cases not covered directly by the configurations, custom JavaScript and CSS can be added. These custom scripts can be invoked on form load, on column values change and before/after an item is submitted. For all these cases, scripts can be invoked conditionally based on various values entered in the form. Please refer to this article for form event actions’ basic usage and configurations. This article describes some sample use cases to configure form event actions in NITRO forms. Use Case 1: Clear the attachments column based on a change in the value of another column Sample list schema and use case Standard SharePoint list ‘Category’: Single selection choice: Choice options: ‘Emails’ ‘Internet’ Based on the selected value, retain attachments in corresponding column and clear others ‘Email Files’: NITRO attachments column If selected category is not ‘Emails’, then clear attachments from this column ‘Internet Files’: NITRO attachments column If selected category is not ‘Internet’, then clear attachments from this column Steps to configure Navigate to Crow Canyon NITRO Forms designer for the list -> Form Event Actions (under Advanced section in the left-hand panel) and configure FEA on column value change as shown below: Clear ‘Email Files’: Clear ‘Internet Files’: Note: In this sample we have cleared the NITRO attachments column. We can use this same syntax to clear the values for all other column types as well. Sample Output Use Case 2: Append multiple users in a multi-selection enabled person or group column Sample list schema and use case Standard SharePoint list ‘Approval Notification’: Multiple selections enabled person or group column Populate multiple users in this column in new form Steps to configure Navigate to Crow Canyon NITRO Forms designer for the list -> Form Event Actions (under Advanced section in the left-hand panel) and configure FEA on form load as shown below: Update the form controls action: Script: var users = [\"james@contoso.com\", \"scott@contoso.com\"]; return users; Note: Specify the email ID of users as required. Use Case 3: Show a popup message when number column value is greater than some value Sample list schema and use case Standard SharePoint list ‘Number of Employees’: Number column Show a popup message if the ‘Number of Employees’ column value is greater than 1. Steps to configure: Navigate to Crow Canyon NITRO Forms designer for the list -> Form Event Actions (under Advanced section in left-hand panel) and configure FEA on column value change as shown below: Configure execute script action: Script: window.alert(\"Please attach spreadsheet with employee data\"); Note: Replace the message as required. Use Case 4: Show/hide a column based on entered date being less than 28 days from today or not Sample list schema and use case Standard SharePoint list ‘Due Date’: Date column ‘Show Rush Notification’: Yes/No column (default value is ‘No’) This is a hidden column that will be updated using FEA based on ‘Due Date’ column value. ‘Rush Justification’: Single line of text column Show this column only if ‘Due Date’ column value is less than 28 days from today. Steps to configure Navigate to Crow Canyon NITRO forms designer for the list -> Select ‘Show Rush Notification’ column -> Configure hide permission on this column from the column settings (in the right-hand panel). Configure FEA to update ‘Show Rush Notification’ column value based on ‘Due Date’ column value. Click ‘Form Event Actions’ (under Advanced section in left-hand panel) and configure FEA on column value change as shown below: Configure update form controls action: Script: var varDate = new Date(); varDate.setDate(varDate.getDate() + 28); var DateNeeded = _ccs_FormUI.fetchColumnValueUI(\"Column Internal Name\"); var validation = false; if (DateNeeded) { if (typeof DateNeeded == \"string\") { DateNeeded = DateNeeded.replace(/-/g, \" \"); } validation = Date.parse(DateNeeded) >= Date.parse(new Date(varDate.toDateString())); } if (validation == true){ return \"No\"; } if(validation == false){ return \"Yes\"; } Note : Replace highlighted text with ‘Due Date’ column internal name. Configure show/hide column permissions on ‘Rush Justification’ column. Hide for everyone: Show if ‘Show Rush Notification’ column value is ‘Yes’: Use case 5: Disable non-working calendar days or enable specific days in date and time controls Sample list schema and use case Standard SharePoint list ‘Date’: Date and time column Disable non-working days, i.e., Saturday"

Tickets: Portal Ticket: 2. ‘‘Related KB Articles’ in Tickets form: Related KB Articles : In Tickets form, KB articles are shown in “Related KB Articles” listing in “Knowledge Base” tab. These articles are for the technicians in the backend site. When resolving the Ticket, staff members can select the relevant articles as per the resolution of the Ticket. This creates an association between the problem listed in the Ticket and the article that was used to resolve it. This increases the rating for the article in “Knowledge Base” list when the Ticket gets closed. And this association is used by NITRO bot to show the most relevant and rated articles for the issues mentioned by users in the bot chat. Create KB Article : If there are no existing articles matching with the issue in the Ticket, the technician can check “Create KB Article” box to indicate that a KB article is required for this Ticket. When a Ticket is closed, the article is automatically created with information in the Ticket. Note : The KB article gets created as a list item in “Knowledge Base” list based on the mappings specified in “Configuration” list. To know more details about KB mappings, refer: “General Configuration” link in Application Administration workspace. Knowledge Base list KB articles can be created directly using “New KB Article” quick launch link under Tickets. Below is the KB form. Columns used in the KB form: Category : This column is used to group the articles in “Articles by Category” section on “Search Knowledge Base Articles” page. Issue Type : This column is used to filter the articles based on the issue type selection in Tickets form. Rating : This column is used to show “Top Rated Articles” in “Search Knowledge Base Articles” page. Show in frequently used KB Articles : This column is used to show the articles in “Frequently Used Article” section in the “Search Knowledge Base Article” page Target Audience : This column is useful to separate the articles based on the target audience (external/internal). There can be a requirement to have certain KB articles only for staff and not to show them to end users. This can be done by restricting these articles from appearing in the portal site. For this, item level permissions can be configured on KB articles based on target audience. Refer to this article to configure item level permissions on KB Articles using NITRO Workflows. Search Knowledge Base Articles Page ‘Knowledge Base’ is a quick way to search KB Articles. This is configured as a top navigation link in the site as shown below: We can search articles directly by entering a keyword, category, issue type or title in the search box. Frequently Used Articles : This section is useful for articles that are relevant for frequently occurring issues. Enabling “Show in frequently used KB Articles” will show the KB articles in this section. Top Rated Articles : Articles are rated automatically according to their usage in resolving Tickets. The top-rated articles are those that are frequently used in resolving Tickets. KB articles will be shown on page based on the KB rating. Articles by Category : KB articles will be grouped based on category. In this section we find count of articles under each category.

For example, it can show sum/min/max/count of child items in the associated items grid. There is also an option to use JavaScript for advanced calculations for aggregates. However, this value is in a grid and not in any column in the main item. If this is required, then the form event action feature of NITRO forms can be used to update aggregate value in a column in the main item on addition of a new child item or a change of any value in any child item. Sample list schema and use case Standard SharePoint list ‘Time Tracking’: NITRO associated items column in the main list ‘Cost’: Currency column in the associated items grid ‘Total Cost’: Currency column in the main list The aggregate of ‘Cost’ column is updated in ‘Total Cost’ column in the main item. That is, the sum of the cost value in the child items is set in total cost column on the main item. Steps to configure Navigate to Crow Canyon NITRO Forms designer for the list -> Form Event Actions (under Advanced section in the left-hand panel) and configure FEA on column value change as shown below: Update form controls action: Script: var linkedColumnName = \"AssociatedColumnInternalName\"; var itemCost = \"Cost\"; var objLinkedColumn = _ccs_FormUI.linkItemsColumnSettings[linkedColumnName]; var grid = $(\"#\" + objLinkedColumn.ControlID).data(\"kendoGrid\"); var gridData = grid.dataSource.data(); var itemCount = gridData.length; var TotalCost = 0; for (var i = 0; i < itemCount; i++) { var objRow = gridData[i]; var rating = Number(objRow[itemCost]); TotalCost = TotalCost + rating; } return TotalCost; Note : Replace ‘AssociatedColumnInternalName’ with the internal name of ‘NITRO Associated Items’ column in the main list. Replace ‘Cost’ with the internal name of the column from the associated list that is to be used for calculating the aggregate.

    "text": " Parse CSV action in NITRO Workflows and Custom Actions Parse CSV action in NITRO Workflows and Custom Actions 1827 views 3 min , 41 sec read 2 Description A CSV (Comma-separated values) file is a delimited text file that uses a comma to separate values. Each line of the file is a data record. Each record consists of one or more columns, separated by commas. Excel data is different from CSV. To convert the excel file to a CSV file, open the excel data file -> File tab -> Click Save As -> Select save as CSV file. The parse CSV action is used to create items in a SharePoint list using the records from CSV data. It can also be used to update existing items in the list using a matching criterion. CSV data can come from a SharePoint list item attachment or an item column that has the data in CSV format. Run for: This specifies the source for CSV data. Current Item: Read the CSV data from current item. Query List: Read the CSV data from one or more items fetched as part of a query list action. Variable : Read the CSV data from a workflow variable. Get CSV data from: Select one of the options to read CSV data. Attachments: Select this option if CSV data is in one or more item attachments. We can filter the files by specifying the type of the file. For example, we can enter file extension as .csv. Note that all matching attachment files will be processed if there are multiple attachments in the item. Column: Select this option if CSV data is in a column in the list item. Multiple lines of text type columns are listed for this purpose. Target List Settings Select target site and list to create or update the items. Column Mappings This section is used to map data from columns in CSV data to SharePoint list item columns. CSV column names are specified in square brackets. A fixed value is specified directly. A mapping can consist of both fixed value and one or more CSV columns. Please refer to below examples. Column value: Specify the column name from CSV data/Fixed value. Value type Example CSV column [Invoice Number] Custom Value Ordered Concatenation of one or more CSV columns/custom values [Invoice Number] _[ID] Advanced Settings Update item if it already exists: Check this option to update existing items. This can be used if the SharePoint list already has the items and the requirement is to add or update column data for these existing items. In this case, the first step is to find the matching item in SharePoint. If the item is found then it is updated, else a new item is created. If this option is not checked then a new list item is always created for every record in CSV data. Item fetch query: To identify the specific SharePoint list item to update for each CSV record, a CAML query needs to be specified. Include the required columns in query to fetch the item to update. CSV column data is specified in square brackets as shown in the example below. <View><Query><Where><Eq><FieldRef Name='AssetID' /><Value Type='Text'>[Asset ID]</Value></Eq></Where></Query></View> In this case, each CSV record has the Id of the Asset and this Id is also there in ‘AssetID’ column of the SharePoint list. For each CSV record, it will try to fetch the item with the matching Asset Id in the SharePoint list and update the item if it is found. If the list item with Asset Id is not found, a new item will be created in SharePoint list. Note that the query can have more than one condition and we can include more than one column from the CSV in the query. Advanced Settings: DateValType: By default, date time values in CSV are assumed to be in UTC. If these are in some other time zone, then specify the time zone name, for example – ‘Eastern Standard Time’. For a list of the time zone names, please refer to this article . MaxCSVRowstoProcess: Specify the max number of rows to process from the CSV data. Default maximum rows to be processed for event-based (item added/updated) and async workflows is 200, and for timer based and scheduled workflows it is 500. Batch Settings: These settings are considered if ‘ Update item if it already exists ’ is checked. For every row in CSV data, a call is made to SharePoint to find the list item that needs to be updated. If there are several rows in CSV data then it involves numerous calls to SharePoint. It can also result in calls being rejected by SharePoint (HTTP 429 error). Batch settings can be used to reduce calls to SharePoint by querying multiple items in one call. EnableBatch : Default value for this property is false. Set this to true to enable querying items in batches. BatchSize : Specify the number of items to fetch in one call (default value is 50). Normally, there is no need to change this value. BatchQuery : Specify the batch query. Please refer to the example below for these settings. ValueType: Specify the data type of the SharePoint column that is used in the batch query. Normally this will have value ‘Text’. UniqueColumnPlaceholder: Specify the column name from CSV data that contains the u"

There could be multiple open tasks for a technician and the instructions in this article will send single email with a link to his/her open tasks list view. Summary of steps Create a custom list ‘Site Workflows’. Configure ‘Open Tasks’ list view in tasks list. Configure ‘My open tasks’ list view in tasks list. Configure scheduled workflow. Detailed steps 1. Create a custom list ‘Site Workflows’. Navigate to the site -> Site Contents -> create a custom list ‘Site Workflows’. Create a new list item in “Site Workflows” list with ‘Title’ column value as “Notify Task assignee if there is any open task”. Note: Title can be anything. We will use this title in scheduled workflow configurations later in this article. 2. Configure ‘Open Tasks’ list view in tasks list. In this example, “Approver Tasks” is the tasks list, “Assigned To” is the person or group column and “Task Status” is the choice column in this list. Navigate to Site Contents -> ‘Approver Tasks’ list -> List Settings -> ‘Create View’ and configure ‘Open Tasks’ filtered view as shown below: 3. Configure ‘My open tasks’ list view in tasks list. Configure ‘My open tasks’ filtered view in tasks list as shown below: Copy ‘My Open Tasks’ list view URL. After configuring ‘My Open Tasks’ list view, go to the list -> Select ‘My Open Tasks’ list view -> Copy the view URL from browser window and paste it in notepad. We will use this URL to add a link in mail body in NITRO workflow later in this article. Sample URL: https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/IT/Helpdesk/Lists/ApproverTasks/My%20Open%20Tasks.aspx 4. Configure a scheduled workflow. Navigate to Site Settings -> Crow Canyon NITRO Apps -> NITRO Workflows. Configure a scheduled workflow on ‘Site Workflows’ list with “Get Item(s) from”, query builder setting (‘Title’ equal ‘Notify Task assignee if there is any open task’) as shown below: Define an empty variable ‘OpenTasks’. Configure a query list action to query open tasks from ‘Approver Tasks’ list. Define variable mapping for ‘OpenTasks’ variable as shown below: Variable value: Query open tasks##$variablecollection(;#,[Assigned To|AssignedTo]) With this, task assignees of all the open tasks are mapped to ‘OpenTasks’ variable. We will use this to send email in the next step. Configure send mail action to notify all open tasks assignees as shown below: Note: We are adding all assignees to “BCC”, so they won’t know who all are included in this email. Since “To” address is mandatory, add an email address to it, we have added ‘Managers’ person or group column in this example. Syntax to use variable value in recipients: VariableName##Value Example: OpenTasks##Value Configure the mail template as needed and save settings. Insert ‘My Open Tasks’ list view link of ‘Approvers Tasks’ list in the mail template from notepad that was copied above in #3.b.

This article assumes that NITRO Studio is already installed in your SharePoint environment. You can refer to this article for NITRO Studio installation. Debugging service needs to be installed on one of the SharePoint servers in the farm. This installation will enable workflow debugging feature that can be used to develop and troubleshoot NITRO workflows. Summary of steps: Install NITRO Workflows Debugger Service Install NITRO Web API Update NITRO Workflows farm properties Instructions Install NITRO Workflows Debugger Service 1.Download and copy the NITRO Workflows debugger service package into the SharePoint server. 2. Unblock the “WFDebuggerService.zip” file 3. Extract the folder and move it to NITRO Studio installation folder on your SharePoint server. For example, if NITRO Studio is installed in “C:\\Program Files\\Crow Canyon\\NITRO Studio” folder, then copy WFDebuggerService folder to a sub-folder so that it will be located at path “C:\\Program Files\\Crow Canyon\\NITRO Studio\\WFDebuggerService” 4. Open command prompt and navigate to below path and then run the command to install the debugging service. Path : C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319 Command : installutil <<Path>>\\CrowCanyon.WFDebuggerService.exe Ex : installutil C:\\Program Files\\Crow Canyon\\NITRO Studio\\WFDebuggerService\\CrowCanyon.WFDebuggerService.exe 5. Open Windows Services Manager on the server. Press the Win + R keys on your keyboard, to open the Run window. Then, type “services. msc” and press OK. 6. Verify that “CrowCanyonWFDebuggerService” is there in the services listing 7. Modify the service account of “CrowCanyonWFDebuggerService” to administrator account: Select “CrowCanyonWFDebuggerService” in the services listing -> Right click -> Properties -> Navigate to “LogOn” tab and specify the administrator account that is a domain user and local administrator and SharePoint farm administrator. 8. Start the service Install NITRO Web API This component is used by workflow debugger service. Debugger service uses a list (“NITROWFDebugSessions”) to manage debugging sessions and this list is automatically created by this API. Debugger service and this list is common across the farm and is required to be created only once in any of the site collections in the farm. You can select the site collection where you are currently deploying NITRO Studio or any of the existing site collections. Please note the URL of the site collection where you want this list to be created. Also note the web application of this site collection and the application pool of that web application. This API will be installed in the same application pool. Below are the steps to install NITRO Web API component. 1. Download and copy the “NITROWebAPI” package to the SharePoint server 2. Extract the folder and unblock it 3. Paste the “NITROWebAPI” folder in below location 4. Location: C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot 5. Open IIS Manager 6. Select Sites and create a new site as shown below: 7. After creating the site, select the site and click “Browse website” 8. This will open the site in the browser, copy the URL of the site: Example URL: http://localhost:1100/api/rest Modify the URL by replacing “localhost” with the server name and port number used while creating the “NITROWebAPI” site: For example, modified URL will be like: http://WIN12SP2019:1100/api/rest Update NITRO Workflows farm properties In this step we will create two farm level properties so that debugging service can access the NITRO Web API component and the list to manage the debugging sessions. For this we need the site collection URL noted above for hosting the list “NITROWFDebugSessions”. And we need the URL of the NITRO Web API site (step #7 above). Open SharePoint Management Shell and run the below script: Script : $farm=Get-SPFarm $farm.Properties.Add(“NITROWFDebugSessionSite”, “<< URL of the site collection where list ‘’ is to be created. >>”) $farm.Properties[“NITROWebAPIURL”] = “<< NITRO Web API site URL >>”; $farm.Update() Note: In above script, specify the site collection URL in second line, example: $farm.Properties.Add(“NITROWFDebugSessionSite”, “http:// WIN12SP2019:1000/sites/helpdesk”) And in third line, specify the NITRO Web API URL, example: $farm.Properties[“NITROWebAPIURL”] = “http:// WIN12SP2019:1100/api/rest”; About supportTeam View all posts by supportTeam → © 2025 Crow Canyon Systems, Inc.

Summary of steps Create site and lists schema Validate site schema Install NITRO Studio Export and import NITRO configurations (Forms, Custom Actions and Workflows) Reconfigure other NITRO components Configure workspace/site pages Register License Detailed steps Create site and lists schema In SharePoint Online, we cannot take source site collection backup and restore it in target site collection like SharePoint on-premises. We must take the list templates from source site manually and create lists using these list templates in target site. When doing this, lookup columns will be broken in target site. We need to recreate those columns manually with same internal name along with other column settings and update the required views. Validate site schema Go to site contents and make sure that list names match in both source and target sites. Go to the list that has NITRO Forms/Workflows/Custom Actions configured, go to list settings, open a column, check the internal name and column settings, they all should match with corresponding source list column settings. If we create list using list template, then we only need to check this for the columns that we recreate as mentioned in #1 above. We can find the internal name of the column as shown in address bar of browser when we open a column: Install NITRO Studio Reference:  https://www.crowcanyon.help/article/424/ Note: If any custom migration tool is used, then skip “Site Assets” library from the data migration if there are no other files except NITRO configurations in “CCS” folder, because these files will be created after we import/reconfigure NITRO configurations. If the “CCS” folder data in “Site Assets” library is already migrated, then delete “CCS” folder manually in target site. Export and import NITRO configurations (Forms, Custom Actions and Workflows) Reference:  https://www.crowcanyon.help/article/445/ Note: This article does not indicate custom actions, but we do support NITRO custom action export/import. Reconfigure other NITRO components If other NITRO components like list views, reports, print templates, list formatting, ID column, linked items etc. are used in source environment, then configure them manually in target site. Configure workspace/site pages Contact  sharepointsupport@crowcanyon.com  for licensing target site. We need source site and target site URLs.

This metadata will be updated in two ways in Tickets in standard helpdesk applications. Tickets created directly from NITRO forms Email to Ticket conversion This article describes the steps to configure additional requester metadata like Job Title, Office etc. in Tickets list. Summary of steps: Find attribute name in user profile properties SharePoint Online SharePoint On-premises User Profile Active Directory Configure auto-fill settings in Tickets list forms General Configurations Note : This article is same for IT, Facilities and Request Management applications and only difference is the name of the main list (Tickets list). Below instructions are given as per Tickets list name, please use the corresponding list name based on the application. For IT Helpdesk application – ‘Tickets’ For Facilities application – ‘Work Orders’ For Request Management application – ‘Requests’ Detailed steps In this article, we have configured “Office” additional property in “Requester Location” column in Tickets list. 1. Find attribute name in user profile properties To configure additional requester properties in Tickets list, we need to find the attribute/property name from User Profile or Active Directory. In this article, we have described the steps to find the attribute name in SharePoint online and on-premises. SharePoint Online: Go to ‘Admin Center’ -> SharePoint -> More features -> User profiles -> ‘Manage User Properties’ -> Edit required property and find the property name as shown below. Copy internal name of user profile attribute SharePoint On-premises: In SharePoint On-premises, we can get the user information from user profile and Active Directory. Based on our requirement, we need to find the attribute name in User Profile or Active Directory. User Profile: To find the attribute name in User Profile, go to Central Administration -> Application Management -> Manage Service Applications -> Click User Profile Service Application -> Manage User Properties under people section in User Profile Service page -> Edit required property and find the property name as shown in above screenshots (same as SharePoint online). Active Directory: To find the user attribute names in Active Directory, please refer below link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/attributes-all 2. Configure auto-fill settings in Tickets list forms 1.Create “Requester Location” column in Tickets list. Internal Name: RequesterLocation Display Name: Requester Location Type: Single line of text 2. Add “Requester Location” column created above to Tickets list forms Navigate to the list -> List settings -> Crow Canyon NITRO Forms -> Drag and drop “Requester Location” column to the form in “Tickets” and “PortalTicket” forms 3. Next, configure auto fill settings in “Tickets” and “PortalTicket” forms as shown below: 4. Configure auto-fill settings as shown below: Edit “Requester” configurations and configure “Office” property as shown below. Note : For SharePoint On-premises, we will see Active Directory option in “Auto-fill User Information” settings. If we use “Active Directory” then configure the “Office” property as per the Active Directory attribute name and also we need to specify the “Active Directory Connection Settings” in Crow Canyon NITRO Site Settings. Go to the Site -> Site Settings -> Crow Canyon NITRO Site Settings under Site Administration -> Expand Active Directory Connection Settings and specify the LDAP configuration settings. LDAP Path : Specify the LDAP path Ex : LDAP://ADServerIPAddress/CN=Partitions,CN=Configuration,DC=Domain,DC=Extension; In above example: ADServerIPAddress: IP Address of the Active Directory Server DC=Domain (Domain of the Active Directory) DC=Extension (extension of the Active Directory) E.g. for crowcanyon.com, domain will be “crowcanyon” and extension will be “com” LDAP Server: Specify IP address of the Active Directory server LDAP User Name: Specify user login name for account having required permissions on the Active Directory LDAP Password: Specify the password for user 4. Configure column mapping. Click ‘New Mapping’ button -> Choose the ‘column’ from drop-down for mappings -> Select ‘Other Property’ in ‘User Property’ column -> Paste the internal name of user profile attribute (copied in #1. above). 3. General Configurations Configure the “Office” property in Configurations list item as shown below: 1. Add “Requester Location” choice value in “Requester Meta Data Colum"

Files/documents can be attached to an item from ‘Attachments’ section in NITRO form or using ‘NITRO Attachments’ column. We can add multiple NITRO attachments columns anywhere in the form as per the requirement. These columns can have different set of validations and permissions. Example, we can limit the number of attachments to be added for an item or allow only specific type of files such as jpg, pdf, doc, etc. that can be attached. ‘Form Event Actions’ can be configured to enhance its functionality. In this article, we have described below: Create NITRO Attachments column in NITRO forms Delete standard “Attachments“ section from NITRO forms Configure permissions for NITRO Attachments column Configure validation for NITRO Attachments column Sample use case In this sample use case, we have created “User Attachments” and “Staff Attachments” NITRO Attachments columns in NITRO Forms, one for the users and other for the staff. Based on the logged in user, permissions are configured to show or hide these attachment columns If logged in user is from staff group, then show “Staff Attachments” column and hide “User Attachments” column If logged in user is from user group then show “User Attachments” column and hide the “Staff Attachments” column Validation on NITRO attachments column to allow maximum of one file of “PDF” type. Detailed steps 1. Create ‘NITRO Attachments’ column Go to the list -> List Settings -> Crow Canyon NITRO Forms -> Click ‘Create Column’ button -> Create ‘NITRO Attachments’ column. Column internal name: UserAttachments Column display name: User Attachments Column internal name: StaffAttachments Column display name: Staff Attachments 2.

Show for logged in user if he/she is a member of the ‘User’ group. Note : Similarly, configure the permissions for ‘Staff Attachments’ column (there will be a ‘Staff’ group for these users). 4. Remove standard ‘Attachments’ section below the form. otherwise, all the attached documents (user attachments and staff attachments) will be shown in this section to all the users. To delete the “Attachments” section, right click the ‘Attachments’ section and click delete. Note: To add ‘Attachments’ section to the form, expand ‘Form Controls’ section in the left-hand panel and drag and drop ‘Attachment’ on to the form.

Standard functionality does not support formatting options like table cell spacing, cell padding and border etc. We can modify the HTML code to set table format, however it is difficult and error prone. And it needs to be done separately for each item where table is used in the column value. NITRO forms support several features to extend the functionality of standard forms and columns. For table formatting, we can use ‘Custom CSS’ option in NITRO forms. With this option, tables can be formatted without modifying the HTML source code. Also, it can be done in form settings once and there is no need to do this for each item separately. In this sample use case, we have configured ‘Custom CSS’ to format table width and border for tables in a multiple lines of rich text column. The CSS can be changed as per the formatting required. Column name used in this case is “Results”. Detailed steps 1.Create multiple lines of enhanced rich text column. To create new column, go to the list -> List Settings -> Create column -> Create multiple lines of rich text column as shown below: Note : We can configure the custom script for existing columns also. 2. Add above created column to NITRO forms. Go to the list -> List Settings -> Crow Canyon NITRO Forms -> Drag and drop the above created column on to the form. 3. Add below script in ‘Custom CSS’. Go to ‘Advanced’ section in left hand panel -> Custom CSS. Custom CSS: #row_ColumnInternalName table{     width:100%; } #row_ColumnInternalName td {       border: 1px solid #333232; } Note: 1. Replace ‘ColumnInternalName’ (highlighted above) with internal name of multiple lines of enhanced rich text column configured above. To know the column internal name, please refer this article . 2. Configure the same CSS for multiple columns by modifying the column internal names. Ex: #row_Description table{     width:100%; } #row_Description td {       border: 1px solid #333232; } #row_WorkLog table{     width:100%; } #row_WorkLog td {       border: 1px solid #333232; } Sample output Before setting default table width and border After setting default table width and border About supportTeam View all posts by supportTeam → © 2025 Crow Canyon Systems, Inc.

Please refer this article for more details and examples. FEAs can be triggered on form load or on a column value change by a user. There are some special scenarios where standard triggers do not work reliably and this article covers one such case. On form load, logged in user is auto populated in a person and group column and user’s department in a lookup column. Based on this department value, we need to fetch a column value from department list using FEA. FEA with form load trigger will not work directly in this case as there is some gap in populating user and user’s department after form load. For this we need to write a script to wait until the lookup column loads and then trigger an event for the lookup column. This article describes FEA for this case by taking an example list schema and configuration. You can adapt this as per your use case. Requirement List Schema Departments Title Cost Requests Title Requester (person or group) Department (lookup to Departments list) Total Budget (Currency) In Requests list new item form: Auto populate logged in user in “Requester” person or group column using auto-fill settings in NITRO Forms. Auto populate logged in user’s department (from user’s profile) in “Department” lookup column using auto-fill settings in NITRO Forms. Based on the “Department” column value, fetch the department item from “Departments” list and update the department cost in “Total Budget” column Detailed steps: Below configurations are in NITRO Forms for the ‘Requests’ list described above. 1. Configure Auto-fill User Information Configure auto-fill user information settings to populate the logged in user and the user’s department in “Requester” and “Department” lookup column. Go to the list -> List Settings -> Crow Canyon NITRO Forms -> Auto-fill User Information under “Form Settings” and configure as shown below: 2. Configure form event actions We will configure two Form Event Actions: Form Event Action 1: Wait for the department lookup column to get loaded and value to get auto filled. This action is not required if user is directly selecting the department column value. In that case FEA 2 is enough as it will trigger when user selects a value. It is required in this special case to trigger the second FEA as it will not trigger if department value is set with user auto fill. Form Event Action 2: Update total budget This is the normal FEA to fetch department list item and use it to set value in a column in Request list. It is triggered whenever department column value is changed. Configure form actions as shown below: 1. Form Event Action 1: Action to wait for department lookup column to load on the form This action will execute a script that will check and wait for the “Department” lookup column value to get filled. Action 1: Wait For Department Load Configure execute script action as shown below: Script : Download the script from below: Script Download Note : In above downloaded script, replace “Department” with actual column internal name. To know the column internal name, please refer this article Action 2: Set Department to trigger Event Configure update form control action to trigger the event for ‘Department’ column value change. For this we need to do a dummy update of the “Department” column value. Form Event Action 2: Update total budget Configure form event action as shown below: Action 1: GetDepartment Configure fetch item action to get the item from “Departments” list Value used in query builder condition: Action 2: Update total budget Configure update form control action to update the “Total Budget” with “Cost” from the department item.

This helps in delivering a message to user before they confirm form submission. It is also helpful in case submit button is unintentionally clicked by the user. In this article, confirmation box is shown to get confirmation about NITRO form submission. On clicking submit button, confirmation box pops up, the user will have to click either “OK” or “Cancel” to proceed. If user clicks “OK” then the form is submitted. Else the form is not submitted, and a message is displayed above the ‘Submit’ button. The user can then make required changes and resubmit the form. Detailed Steps Hide ‘Save’ button from the NITRO Forms. Go to the list -> List Settings -> Crow Canyon NITRO Forms -> Expand ‘Layouts and Theme’ section from right hand panel -> Check ‘Hide Save Button’. Add ‘Submit Action’ to the form. Expand ‘Actions’ menu -> drag and drop ‘Submit Action’ on to the form. Configure ‘Pre-Save Process’ script.  From ‘Button Settings’ in right hand panel, click ‘Edit’ button to configure ‘Pre-Save Process’ script.  Pre-Save Process Script: if (confirm(\"Do you want to submit the form?\") == true) { functionCallback(); } else { functionCallback(true, \"Please click 'Submit' after making required changes on the form.\"); } Note: Replace “Do you want to submit the form?” with required confirmation message. Replace “Please click ‘Submit’ after making required changes on the form.” with required message displayed on clicking ‘Cancel’. Apply settings and publish the NITRO Forms. Sample output: Confirm box pops up on clicking ‘Submit’. The form is submitted on clicking ‘OK’. A message is displayed if user clicks ‘Cancel’ and user will have to click Submit button again after making required changes on the form.

SharePoint does not return more than 5000 items in a list view and shows the list view threshold error message in views. In NITRO List Search settings, if the selected SharePoint list view has more than 5000 items, then the search does not work. In this scenario the web part shows an error message, “There was an error in processing: The attempted operation is prohibited because it exceeds the list view threshold.”. This article has steps to overcome SharePoint list view threshold limitations and enable search on large lists with NITRO List Search web part. Sample use case Suppose ‘All Items’ list view for Ticket list has more than 5000 items, that is, it exceeds the list view threshold limit. To overcome this limitation, we can split the list items into multiple filtered SharePoint list views such as: Tickets for a specific year Last year Tickets First six-month Tickets of current year Last 120-day Tickets, etc. Here, views are based on a date column such as the created date. This column should be indexed for views to work. To search Tickets from these views, configure NITRO List Search for Tickets list and select these views in list search settings. For more details on list search component, refer this article . Detailed steps Configure multiple SharePoint list views with filters, such that the views return less than 5000 items. Use indexed columns to filter SharePoint list views. Add multiple views in NITRO List Search settings. Select indexed list columns from ‘Columns to search’ drop down. Search will be performed on specified columns. About supportTeam View all posts by supportTeam → © 2025 Crow Canyon Systems, Inc.

Earlier syntax of functions and placeholders continues to be supported. Expression builder is an easier way to configure complex mappings. Function parameters are directly configurable in UI. Unlike earlier syntax, Expression builder supports nested functions. Expression builder supports below types of expressions in Custom Actions and Workflows Current Item ‘Run For’ Item Loop Control Item Variables Functions Fixed Value Contextual To use expression builder in column mappings, go to the actions configured in custom actions/NITRO Workflows, ‘Add column mappings’ and click ellipses icon to define the expression for column value. Expression builder in Custom Actions 1.Current Item Select this expression type to use current list item (on which the custom action/NITRO Workflow is running) column placeholders in column mappings. 2. ‘Run For’ Item  This expression type will be shown only for actions (like add and update item actions) that are configured to run for query list item collection or variable collection. Select this expression type to loop the query list item collection column placeholder in column mapping. For sample use cases, refer ‘Use Case 2’ and ‘Use Case 3’ below in this article. 3. Loop Control Item Select this expression type to use the current iteration value of the loop item in the column mappings. Note : There are below different type of loops in Custom Actions and in NITRO Workflows. This expression type will return different output for different type of loops. For more details about the loop feature, refer this article: https://www.crowcanyon.help/article/696/ Number We can use this loop type to iterate the execution for a fixed number of times. We can specify the range using ‘Start Number’ and ‘End Number’ in the loop control settings. Below is the sample loop configuration for ‘Number’ type. In this configuration, static numbers are defined in ‘Start Number’ and ‘End Number’. As per the below screenshot, it will iterate the execution for 5 times as the ‘Start Number’ starts from 1 and on each iteration, ‘Start Number’ will be incremented by 1. When we use the ‘Loop Control Item’ expression type in the column mappings, output will be like below: Output : 1 st Iteration: 1 2 nd Iteration: 2 3 rd Iteration: 3 4 th Iteration: 4 5 th Iteration: 5 Date We can use this loop type to iterate the execution based on a date range. We can specify the ‘Start Date’ and ‘End Date’ in the loop control settings. Below is the sample loop configuration for ‘Date’ type. In this configuration, static dates are defined in ‘State Date’ and ‘End Date’ For example, loop configurations are like below:  Start Date : 07/05/2022 End Date : 11/05/2022 Increment : 4 Unit : Week In this example ‘Run loop for date type’ is an action name of the loop control Output : 1 st Iteration: 7/05/2022 2 nd Iteration: 8/2/2022 3 rd Iteration: 8/30/2022 4 th Iteration: 9/27/2022 5 th Iteration: 10/25/2022 Query List We can use this loop type to iterate the execution for each item in the result of a query list action. We can configure the query list loop type for single item and multiple items. Below is the sample loop configuration for ‘Query List’ type. ‘Loop Control Item’ expression contains all columns data for the query list item. To get the specific column information from the loop item, we need to use ‘Get Property Value’ function. Query list action: Run loop for above query list items: Loop control item properties used in the column mappings: Column Mappings used in above action: Variable Collection We can use variables to save the column values and use them in required actions in Custom Actions and NITRO workflows. For example, here we have defined a variable with name ‘VarallUsers’. It is assigned the value from ‘Assigned Staff’ column on the item. ‘Assigned Staff’ is a multi-selection enabled person or group column. After this value is assigned, variable ‘VarallUsers’ will have a ‘collection’ of all users who are there in the ‘Assigned Staff’ column on the item. We can use ‘Loop Control Item’ in expression type to create task for each user saved in above variable collection. Assigned To column mapping: 4. Variables We can define the variables in custom actions/NITRO Workflows to save the values and then use this variable result in conditions and column mappings of other actions.

    "text": " Auto-assignment in Crow Canyon helpdesk applications Auto-assignment in Crow Canyon helpdesk applications 744 views 1 min , 57 sec read 0 Applies to: Crow Canyon helpdesk applications (SharePoint Online and On-premises) Description Auto-assignment refers to assigning new Tickets (or Requests) automatically to specified staff based on the configured rules. This can be done in following ways: Based on the Category and Issue Type of the Ticket. Assigning in round-robin fashion to available staff. Priority order for assignment If the Ticket is created with an Issue Type and selected issue type has a designated staff user, then Ticket will be assigned to that user regardless of round-robin configuration. If Ticket is created without Issue Type or the selected issue type does not have a designated staff user, then assignment will be based on round-robin configuration. If Ticket is not assigned based on the Issue Type and round-robin assignment is not configured, then Ticket will not be auto-assigned. It can be assigned manually from the application. 1. Based on Category of the Ticket In this case, Ticket will be assigned to staff based on the selected category and issue type in the Ticket. Issue type values are filtered based on the selected Category in the Ticket. If the selected issue type is configured to be handled by specific staff user, then Ticket will get assigned to that user automatically. To enable assignment based on staff, specify the user in Issue Type item. No other configuration is required to enable this feature. Go to Application Administration -> Auto Assignment tab -> Edit Issue Type and specify the user in the ‘Assigned Staff’ column. Round-robin assignment within Issue Type ‘Assigned Staff’ column in the Issue Type list is a multiple selection enabled column. More than one user can be specified for an Issue Type. We can enable round-robin feature at Issue Type level to assign the Tickets in round-robin fashion. Example: “James Restivo” and “Scott Restivo” are two users specified for Issue Type “Calendar Delegation”. Example : “James Restivo” and “Scott Restivo” are two users specified for Issue Type “Calendar Delegation”. When the first Ticket is created for this Issue Type, it will be assigned to “James Restivo”. When the next Ticket is created with the same Issue Type, it will be assigned to “Scott Restivo” and the cycle will repeat. To enable this feature, Go to Application Administration -> Auto Assignment tab -> Edit the required Issue Type item and enable “Enable Round Robin Assignment”. General Round-robin assignment to staff If Ticket is not assigned based on the issue type, then general round-robin assignment feature can be used. In this case, new Tickets will be assigned to staff configured in the ‘Round Robin Staff’ list. To enable the general round-robin assignment: Configure staff users in ‘Round Robin Staff’ list. Go to application administration -> Auto Assignment -> Create an item for each staff user in ‘Round Robin Staff’ list. Title : Specify title for staff user. Staff : Ticket will be assigned to the user specified in this column. Tickets Count: This value is zero in the beginning. It will be increased by 1 whenever a Ticket is assigned to that user. User with lowest Tickets count will be assigned the next Ticket. This feature needs to be enabled in the Configurations list. Go to application administration -> Auto Assignment -> Edit Configuration item and enable ‘Enable General Auto-Assignment’ as shown below. Note : If Tickets are assigned/re-assigned manually in the application, ‘Tickets Count’ for the corresponding staff users will not be changed in the ‘Round Robin Staff’. There is a workflow that runs every day to update the count of open Tickets assigned to each staff user. About supportTeam View all posts by supportTeam → © 2025 Crow Canyon Systems, Inc.

It is possible to continue or stop action execution based on whether any items are fetched in the query list action execution. A message is shown to user in case custom action execution stops as per the configuration in query list action. But if ‘Auto Close’ setting is enabled, then user is unable to read that message as progress dialog closes immediately. This article has steps to auto-close progress dialog only if action execution is not stopped due to query list action result. Otherwise, the message configured in query list action is shown to the user. Sample use case In this example, it is required to update ‘Sub Project’ column in Main Projects list. A custom action is configured to query Sub Projects list. Update ‘Sub Project’ column in Main Projects list only if any item is found in the query list action and then auto close the custom action dialog. If no item is found in query list action, then do not auto close so that user can read the message. Detailed steps Navigate to custom actions for the list. Go to Main Projects list -> List settings -> Crow Canyon Custom Actions -> Configure a custom action in designer experience. Enable ‘Auto Close’ from action settings. Configure a variable with default value: Variable Name: NITRO_DialogAutoClose Default Value: Open Note: This is a pre-defined variable. Specify same variable name and default value. Initially this value is set to ‘Open’ so that custom action dialog will not auto close. After query list action, if items are fetched, then this value will be set to ‘Close’. In that case no message is to be shown to user and it will auto close. Rest of the steps in this article will clarify this point. Action 1: Add a ‘Query List’ action on the canvas. Configure a query list action to query Sub Projects list. In this example, ‘Only if item(s) found’ option is selected to continue custom action execution. Note: Select any option to continue custom action execution as required. Note that in case of ‘Always’, custom action always executes, so progress dialog always closes after action execution. Only if item(s) found: Next action will execute only if one or more matching item(s) are fetched in this query list action. If item(s) are not fetched, then action execution stops. Message given in ‘Show message if Custom Action execution stopped’ is shown in the progress dialog. Only if no item found: Next action will execute only if no matching items are fetched in query list action. If any items are fetched, then action execution stops. Message given in ‘Show message if Custom Action execution stopped’ is shown in the progress dialog. Add ‘Set Variable’ event on the canvas. Expand ‘Events and Controls’ section -> Drag and drop ‘Set Variable’ on the canvas. Add variable mapping for ‘NITRO_DialogAutoClose’ variable. NITRO_DialogAutoClose: Close Action 2: Add an ‘Update List Item’ action on the canvas. From ‘Actions’ section, drag and drop ‘Update List Item’ action on the canvas to update ‘Sub Project’ column in Main Projects list.

Note : This article is same for IT, Facilities and Request Management applications and only difference is the name of the list (Tickets list). Below instructions are referring to Tickets list name, please use the corresponding list name and the import package based on the application that we have. For IT Helpdesk application – ‘Tickets’ For Facilities application – ‘Work Orders’ For Request Management application – ‘Requests’ Summary of steps Prepare CSV file with Tickets data List Schema Configure NITRO Custom Actions Disable Product App and NITRO Workflows Import Tickets data Process Imported Tickets Enable Product App and NITRO Workflows Detailed Steps It is recommended to import only open Tickets into the live “Tickets” list. Historical Tickets can be imported to “Archived Tickets” list. All the Tickets imported into the live Tickets list will be assigned a new case id. If we would like to capture the case id from old system for reference, please create a text column and map it in the “Parse CSV” action settings. Steps #4, #6 and #7 are not required on historical Tickets imported into “Archived Tickets” list. Pre-requisites: Make sure that all the required SharePoint groups are created in advance if we have data in “Assigned Team” column. Previous system could have different Ticket Ids but new case id will be assigned to all the imported Tickets in SharePoint. Do not map “Case Id” column for storing legacy case id from previous system. If required, please create new text column like “Legacy Case Id” in Tickets list and use it. Make sure that all choice columns have required options in SharePoint list before importing the data. For example, if we have “Priority” column with “Normal”, “Low”, “High” and “Critical” as possible values in CSV then we need to make sure that “Priority” column settings in Tickets/Archived Tickets list are matching with these options. Make sure that all category and issue types (lookup list items) are created prior to importing the data. Create a SharePoint group in site settings and add all possible users to this group. This is to ensure all person or group columns like Requester, Assigned Staff etc. are resolved in SharePoint before we do the actual import. If any user is not resolved prior to the import, it will be left with blank value. Lookup lists should have unique names For example, if we have two categories like “Hardware Request” and “Printer”. Both categories have “Other” issue type. Then we need to change the issue type to “Hardware Request – Other” and “Printer – Other” in SharePoint, update the data in CSV file accordingly. After the data import is completed, we can rename both the issue types to “Other” if required. Prepare CSV file with Tickets data Please contact sharepointsupport@crowcanyon.com for package link. Right click on the downloaded file, go to properties, and unblock it if it is blocked. Extract the package. Package contains below files: Sample CSV file (Tickets.csv) It contains the standard columns from the out of the box Tickets list. We can add additional columns if required. NITRO Custom Actions settings (“Import Tickets data.xml” and “Process Imported Tickets.xml”). In case if we modify the CSV file, then we need to modify the custom action settings as well in step #3 (“Configure NITRO Custom Actions”). CSV file data syntaxes: Single line of text and Multiple lines of text : Specify direct text Ex: Printer is not working Lookup column : Specify lookup column value Ex: Printer Note : Multiple selections are not supported currently. Choice : Specify choice option Ex: High Date and Time: The value entered in the CSV file must be as per the SharePoint site regional settings. Enter the time in 24 hours format. Syntax: Month-Date-Year Hours:Minutes:Seconds Ex: 08-18-2022 5:30:00 Person or Group : Specify display name of user or group Example for user: James Restivo Example for SharePoint group: Helpdesk Owners Note : Multiple selections are not supported currently. Number and Currency:  Specify number values Ex: 500 or 550.50 Yes/No : Specify Yes or No values Ex: Yes List Schema Create a SharePoint list named “Import Tickets” in the site. Note: if this is one time import, then after the data import is completed, we can delete this list. Steps: Go to Site Contents à Create new custom/blank list à Enter name ‘Import Tickets’ and Create. Create an item in this list with the prepared CSV file as an attachment. This item will be used to run ‘Import Tickets data’ custom action in next steps. Create ‘OriginalCreated’ date and time column"

Loop action is used to repeat a step for specific number of times. Below loop options are supported in loop control in Custom Actions and NITRO Workflows. Date Number Query List Variable Collection To configure loop control in Custom Actions and NITRO workflow. Custom actions: Go to custom actions -> Select new custom action -> Expand Events and Controls -> Drag and drop loop control on designer. NITRO Workflows: Go to NITRO Workflows -> Select new workflow -> Expand Events and Controls -> Drag and drop loop control on designer. Loop Control Settings There should always be two or more incoming connections and two outgoing connections from loop control body. One or more connections should be back to the loop control. Sample loop configuration: For below sample configurations, there are two outgoing connections and two incoming connections and one of the incoming connection is connecting back to the loop control. Summary of these connections: Incoming: Connection from a node outside of the loop to start the loop execution Note: There can be multiple nodes from which loop can be initiated Connection from loop body back to loop for repeated steps Note: There can be more than one connections from loop body back to loop control. For example, there can be a gateway inside the loop that decides to continue loop execution or go back to loop control for next iteration. Outgoing: Connection to the loop body to execute each step Connection to a node outside of loop to exit the loop Note : In this document, column mappings are configured in below ways in sample use cases and examples. We can use any one of the below expressions. Without expression builder (Old format) With expression builder (New format) Expression builder is released for Custom Actions. For NITRO Workflows, expression builder will be released soon. Different types of loops Loop Type: Number Use this loop type to iterate the execution for a fixed number of times. We can specify the range using ‘Start Number’ and ‘End Number’ in the loop control settings. Start Number : Specify the number from which we want to start the loop execution. End Number : Specify the number at which we want to stop the loop execution. Increment : Specify the increment value to increase the number in each iteration. Note: End Number should be greater than Start Number Number loop type does not support decimal values in Start Number and End Number. Supported values in Start Number and End Number: Placeholder Example/Scenario Fixed values Start Number: 1 End Number: 5 [Column Display Name|Column Internal Name] Specify ‘Start Number’ and ‘End Number’ from the current list item column placeholder on which the Custom Action/Workflow is running Ex: [Count|Count] Variables Select the start and end numbers from variables. VarStartNumber##Value Query list action name##[Column Display Name|Column Internal Name] To use query list item placeholder, Query list action result should be a single item (not an item collection) Ex: GetConfiguration##[Start Number|StartNumber] Sample loop control configuration for Number type: In this sample configuration, we have used static numbers for ‘Start Number’ and ‘End Number’ in the loop configurations. As per the below screenshot, it will iterate the execution for 5 times as the start number starts from 1 and on each iteration start number will increment by 1. Functions Used to get values from Number Loop Control: We can get the loop control values like current index number, start number, end number and Increment value using below function. Function: Syntax 1 : $GetIterationValue(Loop Control Name) $GetIterationValue(Loop Control Name, parameter) Function : $GetIterationValue(Loop Control Name) This function will return the current iteration value of the loop. Ex : $GetIterationValue(Run loop for number type) As per the above sample loop configuration, ‘Run loop for number type’ is the name of the loop control It will iterate the loop body 5 times starting from value ‘1’ Output : For first iteration current value will be 1, for second iteration current value will be 2 and so on. Supported parameters for number type loop: currentindex startNumber endNumber increment currentindex This parameter will return the current iteration number from the loop when it is executing. Ex : $GetIterationValue(Run loop for number type, currentindex) Output : For first iteration current index value will be 1, for second iteration current index value will be 2 and so on. Note that in case of number loop with starting value and increment as 1, index will be same as loop iteration value. startNumber This parameter will return t"

Refer to this article for more details regarding the loop feature. Update items in a list from a web service response using variable collection loop Replicate assets from asset type using number loop type Run send mail action for query list items using query list loop Close Tickets and Ticket tasks on resolving a problem In all sample use cases, column mappings are shown with expression builder and the old format. We can use any one of them though expression builder is the preferred option. With expression builder (New format) Expression builder is released for Custom Actions. For NITRO Workflows, expression builder will be released soon. Without expression builder (Old format)   Use case 1: Update items in a list from a web service response using variable collection loop In this sample use case, a custom list with title “Users” is being used to store details of the users. ‘Users’ list in SharePoint site has below columns. Column Name Column Type User Id Single line of text First Name Single line of text Last Name Single line of text Email Single line of text Status Choice (Active, Inactive) Details : Configure an invoke web service action and response of this action is stored in a variable. This variable collection will have user details like User Id, Email, First Name and Last Name Web Service used in this example is a publicly available REST API: https://reqres.in/api/users Response variable is then used in loop control configuration. Configure a query list action in the loop body. It will query the user from ‘Users’ list based on the email address extracted from the user data in current loop iteration. If user is found in the ‘Users’ list then update the details of the matching item in the ‘Users’ list. Otherwise, create a new item with details of the user in the ‘Users’ list. Custom Action Define below variables VarUsers VarEmail VarCurrentUser Action 1: GetUsers Configure Invoke Web Service action as shown below. Please note “Define Variable Mappings” section at the bottom. Service response is in JSON format and we need to extract the values as per the structure of the JSON and put it in variables for subsequent usage. Define variable mappings in Invoke Web Service Action: With expression builder: Configure the JSON path function in expression builder as shown below to extract the response from invoke web service action and update it in a variable. This expression builder uses ‘CurrentAction’ as expression type as the response of web service is available in current action. Without expression builder : Variable value used in above: $jsonpath2({CurrentAction}##Value,@$.data) Web Service Response: Response of invoke webservice action is given below. ‘VarUsers’ variable will have the highlighted part of response as it is the extracted ‘data’ element from the response: Please note that JSON path will be different as per the response format of your API. Action 2: Loop all users In above Web API action response, ‘data’ element contains an array (collection) of user data. This collection was stored in variable ‘VarUsers’. We will now configure a loop control to iterate over each user in the response: Action 3: Update VarEmail We now want to store the email of the user in current iteration in a variable. This is done in a set variable action. These variables will be used in subsequent actions. VarCurrentUser: This variable is used to save the current iteration value from a variable collection. With expression builder Without expression builder: Value used in the expression: $GetIterationValue(Loop all users) Note : ‘Loop all users’ is loop control name configured in ‘Action 2’ above Sample output: VarEmail This variable is used to extract the email address from above variable ‘VarCurrentUser’. Output: george.bluth@reqres.in With expression builder: Without expression builder: Variable value used in the expression below: VarCurrentUser##email Action 4: GetUserFromSPList Configure a query list action to query the user from ‘Users’ list based on the email address that we have extracted in the set variable action above. Note that user with this email address may not be there in the list yet. Value used in the condition builder: Email equal %%VarEmail##Value%% Action 5: Verify if user is found or not in the list Configure gateway control to check if user is found in the ‘Users’ list.

Microsoft SharePoint supports granting permissions at site/list/item level to security groups directly without needing to use SharePoint groups. NITRO works on top of SharePoint, so NITRO does not need any special integration for working with standard SharePoint features. We have NITRO specific features like below that could work directly with AD groups along with SharePoint groups and direct users. NITRO Forms Tab/column permissions Submit actions permissions NITRO custom actions Permissions NITRO Security Settings Automatically redirect selected users to different site Whenever the form/custom action etc. need to work with Active Directory groups, we need to grant permissions to “Crow Canyon Azure AD API”. This way NITRO can read the AD groups and its members and check if the logged in user is allowed to perform the operations or not. Steps : Go to site settings, Crow Canyon NITRO Site Settings, expand “Azure Active Directory Connection Settings” and “Grant Permissions” as shown below. “Allow Crow Canyon Azure AD API to read from Azure Active Directory” permission is sufficient for working with permissions in NITRO components. NITRO Forms We can configure permissions on different NITRO Forms components like ‘Tabs/sections’, ‘columns’, ‘actions (submit actions, custom actions, script action)’. All these components have similar settings shown below. “When to apply this permission” -> “If logged in user:” -> “In Users/Groups” setting supports different scenarios mentioned below. Grant permissions to direct user(s) Grant permissions to direct security group(s) from AD Grant permissions to SharePoint groups that have direct users as members Unsupported scenario SharePoint group(s) that have AD security groups as members “When to apply this permission” -> “If logged in user:” -> “In Column” setting supports different scenarios mentioned below. Grant permissions to direct user(s) saved in the selected column on the item. Grant permissions to direct SharePoint group(s) saved in the selected column on the item and that SharePoint group has direct users as members. Grant permissions to direct AD security group(s) saved in the selected column on the item. We need to enable “Load Current User AD Groups” property in “Extended Settings”, under ‘advanced’ section on the left side panel of the NITRO Form designer as shown below to get this feature to work. This additional configuration is provided to not always load the logged in user’s membership AD groups when not required, this is to improve the form performance. Unsupported scenario SharePoint group(s) are saved in the selected column on the item and that SharePoint group has AD security group(s) as member. NITRO Custom Actions We can configure permissions on NITRO custom actions to allow/restrict selected user(s) from executing the custom action using “Conditions” setting shown below. We can configure branches using “Gateway” available under “Events and Controls” section shown below and it has the permissions setting. These components have the permissions settings same as the permissions settings described in NITRO Forms section earlier in this article. Supported and unsupported scenarios are same as NITRO Forms cases. Regarding the “Grant permissions to direct AD security group(s) saved in the selected column on the item” case, we need to enable “Load Current User AD Groups” checkbox in action settings dialog shown below. NITRO Security Settings We can use NITRO Security Settings to allow/redirect logged-in user to a different site when accessing a site. Steps: Go to site settings, Crow Canyon NITRO Site Settings, expand “Security Settings”, configure as shown below. For using direct AD security group(s) in this setting, we need to grant permissions to “Crow Canyon Azure AD API” mentioned in the description section of this article.

In Custom Actions and NITRO Workflows, Generate Document action has an option to use “Microsoft Office API” for generating the document. To use “Microsoft Office API”, Microsoft Office must be installed on the server. On SharePoint servers, newer versions of Microsoft Office cannot be installed. NITRO Office API can be installed on a server different from SharePoint servers so that Office API can be used for document generation. Server must have IIS configured and a licensed version of Microsoft Office installed. Instructions Pre-requisites Install Microsoft office on IIS Server and make sure that office is licensed. Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8 or above should be installed on the server. Refer https://www.crowcanyon.help/article/678 and do the configurations on the server we are using to install the NITRO Office API. Install NITRO Office API 1. Download and copy the “NITROOfficeAPI” package to the IIS Server. 2. Extract the folder, right click on the folder –> properties –> unblock it. Ignore if the folder is not blocked. 3. Paste the “NITROOfficeAPI” folder in the location: ‘C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot’ 4. Open IIS Manager 5. Select Sites and create a new site as shown below: Add Website as shown below, browse the physical path below that is used for #3 above. 6. After creating the site, select the site and click “Browse website” 7. This will open the site in the browser, copy the URL of the site: Example URL: http://localhost:1100/api/msword Modify the URL by replacing “localhost” with the server name and port number used while creating the “NITROOfficeAPI” site: For example, modified URL will be like: http://SP2016:1100/api/msword Update SharePoint Farm Property In this step we will create one farm level property so that Custom Action and Workflow Manager can access the NITRO Office API component. For this we need the URL of the NITRO Office API site (step #7 above). Open SharePoint Management Shell and run the below script: Script: $farm=Get-SPFarm $farm.Properties[\"nitroofficeapiurl\"] =  \"<<NITRO Office API site URL.>>\"; $farm.Update() Note: In above script, specify the NITRO Web API URL, example: $farm.Properties[\"NITROWebAPIURL\"] = \"http://SP2016:1100/api/msword\"; Custom Action NITRO Studio- Custom Actions About supportTeam View all posts by supportTeam → Related Articles NITRO Studio Workshop: Custom Actions and Workflows Revisited Active Directory Groups integration with NITRO Import Tickets using NITRO Custom Actions NITRO Studio Workshop: Invoking Web Services using Workflows & Custom Actions © 2025 Crow Canyon Systems, Inc.

Also, Yes/No column can be represented as a checkbox. If SharePoint list item form has checkboxes, sometimes similar UI is required in document (Word/pdf) that are generated based on that item. Checkboxes support in Word templates ensures that look and feel of generated document is closer to the item form. NITRO document generation now supports this feature. Based on values in SharePoint list item, checkboxes can be checked/unchecked in Word document template. Summary of steps 1.      Enable checkboxes in Microsoft Word. 2.      Create SharePoint list with required columns (or use existing list/columns). 3.      Create a Word template with checkbox controls. 4.      Configure Generate document action. 5.      Map list item columns to checkbox controls in template. 6.      Run the action to generate document. Enable checkboxes in Microsoft Word Checkboxes can be added to Word document from the ‘Developer’ tab. By default, this tab is not visible in the ribbon of Microsoft Word. Please follow below steps to make it visible. Open Microsoft Word and go to File -> Options -> Customize Ribbon. In the Main Tabs section, enable ‘Developer’ tab. After above step, Developer tab will be visible in Word: In Developer tab, checkbox option is available. Move the cursor to the required position in the word document. After that click checkbox in the ribbon to insert it in the required position in the document. For settings of Checkbox, select the ‘Checkbox’ in the document and navigate to properties in ‘Controls’ group of ‘Developer’ Tab. Create SharePoint list with required columns In this article, we will take below examples to map to checkboxes in a word document. Based on values in the SharePoint list item for these columns, corresponding checkboxes will get checked/unchecked in the generated word document. Columns in SharePoint List (Onboarding Request) for which checkboxes are created in MS Word template Single Choice Employee type Full-time Contractor Ad-hoc Multi-choice column Column name: Application Access Column internal name: ApplicationAccess Choice options: SQL Server Active Directory Azure SharePoint Yes/No column Column name: Allow Administrator Access Column internal name: AllowAdministratorAccess Choice options: Yes/No Text column Column name: Employee Name Column internal name: EmployeeName Other columns in SharePoint List for which checkboxes are not created in MS Word template Title column Column name: Title Column internal name: Title Text Column Column name: Employee Name Column internal name: EmployeeName Text Column Column name: Cloud Column internal name: Cloud Text Column Column name: Database Column internal name: Database Expressions Expressions – String concatenate function is used in expression. Based on the output of this function corresponding checkbox will be checked/unchecked. Create a Word template with checkbox controls Checkbox can be single or part of a group with multiple related options. This article will show implementation of checkboxes in the word template for above mentioned column examples Insert a group of checkboxes for single choice column in template To create above mentioned single Choice checkbox controls follow the below steps. Step 1. In word document, type Employee Type as group name and create 3 checkboxes as shown below. These checkboxes are the allowable column values of which only a single value can be selected at a time. Step 2: Go to Content Control properties of a check-box through Developer tab. In the pop-up provide as below: Title: Values of each checkbox should match with possible value(s) of the column. Based on the values in column, corresponding checkbox(es) gets checked.

In this example, it is required to calculate ‘Due Date’ in Tickets list by excluding weekends and holidays specified in ‘Holidays’ list. Summary of steps Create a custom list to maintain list of holidays. Define work week in site regional settings. Configure form event actions to calculate due date. Detailed steps Create a custom list to maintain list of holidays. Go to ‘Site Contents’ -> Create a custom list. ‘Holidays’ is the list name in this example that is created for specifying holidays. It is required to create an item for each holiday in this list. Create below columns in the list: Column Name Column Type StartDate Date and Time (Date only) EndDate Date and Time (Date only) For continuous holidays, specify start date of holidays in ‘StartDate’ column and end date of holidays in ‘EndDate’ column. For single holiday, specify ‘EndDate’ and leave ‘StartDate’ column blank. Sample ‘Holidays’ list: Define work week in site regional settings. Go to site settings -> ‘Regional Settings’ under ‘Site Administration’ -> Define work week as required. Sample work week: Configure form event actions to calculate due date. The projects form has a ‘Start Date’ column that will be entered by the user. User will also enter the number of days required to finish the project in ‘Days’ column. After that, system will automatically calculate the due date based on these two values. Navigate to NITRO Forms designer for Tickets list -> Create below columns and add them to the NITRO Form. Column Name Column Type Start Date Date and Time (Date & Time or Date only) Due Date Date and Time (Date & Time) Days Number (with ‘0’ decimal places) Configure form event actions. Expand ‘Advanced’ section from left-hand panel -> Form Event Actions -> Configure FEA on column value change as shown below: Configure update form controls action to set due date.

Enforce unique values on a combination of column values. Description SharePoint list columns have an option to ‘Enforce unique values’. If enabled, only one item can be created with a specific value for column. When user tries to save the item, SharePoint shows an error if item has duplicate value. This functionality can be enhanced with NITRO in following ways: ‘Enforce unique values’ option is not available for calculated columns. In many cases, we need unique constraint on some combination of column data. Unique value may be based on data (full or partial) in more than column. We can use ‘Form event action’ to generate the required value that needs to be checked for uniqueness. We can run the duplicate value check using ‘Form event action’ as soon as user enters the data. A message can be shown to user using NITRO Forms column validations on the form itself and user does not need to click ‘Save’ button to know that value is duplicate. Duplicate check can be made optional. We can remove the ‘Enforce unique values’ option from column settings but still show the duplicate warning on the form. User can save the item with duplicate value if required. Use case 1 In this sample use case, we have described below scenarios: Requester submits the request by specifying the Invoice number using NITRO forms. If request already exists for a specified invoice number, then show a warning message on the form. This will allow user to verify before submitting another request for the same invoice number. Detailed steps Create “Invoice” column in the list. Based on value in this column, user ‘form event actions’ to check if another request with same invoice number already exists. Column Internal Name: Invoice Column Display Name: Invoice Column Type: Single Line of Text Note that ‘Enforce unique values’ is set to ‘No’ as user will get warning but can still save with duplicate value. Create an index on this column to improve performance and avoid SharePoint list view threshold errors. Create “ShowError” NITRO Managed column from NITRO forms designer. This column will be set using form event actions. Based on this column value show or hide warning message in NITRO form. Go to the list -> List Settings -> Crow Canyon NITRO Forms -> Expand “Create Column” dropdown -> Create ‘NITRO Managed Column’ as shown below: Column Internal Name: ShowError Column Display Name: Show Error Column Type: NITRO Managed Column Drag and drop “Invoice” and “Show Error” columns on to the NITRO form. Hide “Show Error” column on the form as it is used in column permissions and users do not need to see it. Configure ‘Hide’ permission for ‘Show Error’ column as shown below: Hide for everyone. To show warning message, add ‘Line/HTML’ control on the form as shown below and specify the required text. Configure ‘Form Event Actions’ on “Invoice” column value change. Expand ‘Advanced’ section in left hand panel -> ‘Form Event Actions’ -> Configure form event action as shown below: Configure ‘Fetch List Items’ action: This action will fetch the existing item if it exists with same value as the “Invoice” number entered on the form. Configure ‘Update Form Controls’ action: This action will check if another item exists with same value as the “Invoice” number entered on the form using fetch list items action variable. If yes, then script will set the “Show Error” column value to “Yes” otherwise it will be set to “No”. Warning message is shown on the form if “Show Error” column value is “Yes”. Script used above : var itemID = window.ccs_g_FormUI.GetQLItemColumnValues(\"CCSQLGetItem\", \"ID\", true); if (itemID && itemID > 0) { return \"Yes\"; } return \"No\"; functionCallback(); Configure permissions for ‘Line/HTML’ control (added above) so that it is shown only when “Show Error” column value is “Yes”. Hide: Configure hide permission for everyone. Show: Configure show permission when ‘Show Error’ column value is ‘Yes’. Sample output Use case 2 Enforce a unique value based on a combination of column values. Sample list schema ‘Company’: Single selection choice ‘Product Code’: Single line of text column ‘Product Unique Code’: Single line of text column Concatenate “Company” and “Product Code” column values and map it to “Product Unique Code” column. Set validation to enforce unique values in “Product Unique Code” column. ‘Unique Value To Set’: NITRO Managed ‘Text – Short’ column Summary of steps Add an index to “Product Unique Code” column.

Introduction This article describes the functionality and syntax of functions ‘GetGroupMembers’ and ‘Join’ in NITRO Workflows and Custom Actions. Detailed instructions GetGroupMembers This function is used to fetch the users that are members of a SharePoint (SP) group or an Active Directory (AD) group. This function fetches only those users that are directly the members of the specified SP/AD group. It will not fetch users that are members of the nested groups within the group. This function can be defined in two ways: With Expression Builder : Without Expression Builder : Syntax: $getgroupmembers(displayvalue, joinchar, usercolumn, output) Parameters to be defined in above function: Display value : Specify the user attribute that is to be fetched. Below are the supported values: email name id loginname Join char: This is required if the output type is ‘string’. Specify the character/string as a separator between each user value. Example : Semicolon (;) or ;# User column : Specify a person or group column placeholder that will contain one or more AD/SP groups. This person or group column can contain more than one group and this function will get users from all the groups. Note : Direct group names or variables are not supported, only user columns are supported for this parameter. If user column has one or more direct user values (other than groups), then those are also included in the output. Output : Specify the type of output that is to be returned by this function. Below are the supported values for this parameter. “ array “: Get the output as an array. This output can be used to loop through each user and take the required action. For example, using the loop action in custom action or workflow manager a task can be created for each user in the output. “string” : Get the output as a text value where each user attribute will be separated as per the input given to function. Example : In this example, we want to fetch the ‘name’ attribute for each user. Output type is string and separator is semicolon. ‘Assigned Team’ is a user column in the current list. If this column has a SharePoint group as the saved value for an item, then users from that group will be fetched. Example output with ‘name’ attribute : James Restivo;Joe Bloggs;John Smith;Ryan Stephani Example output with ’email’ attribute: jamesr@crowcanyon365.com;joeb@crowcanyon365.com;John.smith@crowcanyon365.com;ryan.stefani@crowcanyon.com Join Function This function takes as input an array of values and outputs a string by concatenating these values. With Expression Builder Without Expression Builder Syntax : $join (separator, [placeholder]) Parameters to be defined in above function: Separator : provide the character or string to separate the values in the output. Placeholder : Provide the variable that has the array of values. Example : In above example, VarUsers : This variable has an array of user values. [“jamesr@crowcanyon365.com”,”joeb@crowcanyon365.com”,”John.smith@crowcanyon365.com”,”ryan.stefani@crowcanyon.com”] Output : jamesr@crowcanyon365.com;#joeb@crowcanyon365.com;#John.smith@crowcanyon365.com;#ryan.stefani@crowcanyon.com Sample use case for GetGroupMembers function: Create tasks for approvers specified in a column in a list item. This action uses “Requests” and “Approval Tasks” lists. “Approvers” is a multi-selection enabled person or group column in “Requests” list. Select ‘Allow selection of’ option to ‘People and Groups’. Mention setting name that allows groups to be selected in user column. “Approvers” column in Request item will be filled with the required group. For each user in the specified group, we need to create a task in the “Approval Tasks” list. “Approval Tasks” list has a lookup to “Requests” list. This way each task will be linked to the request item for which it has been created. Steps : This action is configured on the “Requests” list. Define a variable to get the members in the group specified in ‘Approvers’ column in “Requests” list item. User the variable in the loop action to iterate for each user in the group. Configure a create item action in the loop body to create a task for user in the current loop iteration. Custom Action: Define Variable: Action 1: Run loop for all approvers Configure loop action for variable ‘varApprovers’ defined above. Action 2: Create tasks for all approvers Configure create item action to create task for each user. Column mapping for Assigned To: Action 3: Update worklog in Request Configure update item action to update the worklog in request. Column mapping: Sample output: In below request item, “Crow Canyon Managers” group is selected in the ‘Approvers’ column. Below users are the members of “Crow Canyon Managers” group: James Restivo "

Introduction For SharePoint lists there is a feature to append text in columns of the type ‘Multiple lines of text’. When ‘Append Changes to Existing Text’ is enabled in column settings, changes are shown as a thread in the column. The text entered earlier cannot be changed, and new text is shown above the earlier text. Each version of the item has its own value for this column (blank if not entered while saving the item). Function ‘getcolumnvalueforversion’ can be used to get the column value for a version enabled multiple lines of text column. Value can be fetched for a specific version of the item or for all versions. Note : Source column should be multiple lines of text column with append changes enabled. And to enable this setting, version history should be enabled for the list. Syntax : Without Expression Builder $getcolumnvalueforversion(Column Name,Version,SortOrder,Format,textType) With Expression Builder Parameters to be defined in above function: ColumnName: Specify the internal name of the column. Only the column name is supported; column placeholders are not supported. Supported columns: Multiple lines of Text column with append changes enabled (Example: WorkLog) Choice (Example: Priority) Single Line of Text Number Date and Time Multiple Lines of Text (Example: Description) Unsupported columns: Person and Group Lookup Hyperlink To know the column internal name, go to the list -> List Settings -> Edit the column and find the column internal name in the browser URL as shown below: Ex : WorkLog Version: This parameter has below supported values. All : Return column value from all the versions of the item. First : Return column value from the first version of the item (earliest). Last : Return column value from the most recent version (last). Last-N : Returns the column value from the Nth version before the most recent one. LastNonBlank : Return column value from the latest version where value of this column is not blank. If item is saved without specifying any text for this column, then in that version of the item value of this column will be blank. Enter specific version number : Return column value from the specified version (Ex: 2.0 – returns the value from item version 2.0) Version Column: Here you can directly use the Version column. When you use the Version column as a column placeholder, it will return the latest version number of the item. Usage in $subtract() Function: The version number can be used in functions like $subtract(), which performs arithmetic operations on values. If you want to calculate the difference between the latest version and a previous version of an item. You can pass the version numbers retrieved via the column placeholder into the $subtract() function to compute the version difference. Example: or you can directly use the version number in the $subtract() function to fetch the column value from the specific version. SortOrder: Specify the sorting order for the versioned data for the column. SortOrder is applicable only for version of type ‘All’. Supported values for this parameter are below: LastToFirst : Column value in the latest versions of the item will be before the values entered in earlier versions (latest first). This is the default setting for this parameter. FirstToLast : Values will be in ascending order of the item version (earliest first). Format: Column version value can be fetched with or without header. Every item version has a user and timestamp associated with it. withHeader : Include name of user who created that version (user saving/editing item) and the time at which it was saved. Example: $getcolumnvalueforversion(WorkLog,All,LastToFirst,withHeader) withoutHeader : Only return column value text and not the user or timestamp. Example: $getcolumnvalueforversion(WorkLog,All,LastToFirst,withoutHeader) See the difference in output of “withHeader” and “withoutHeader” format in below screenshot. Custom Value : This option can be used to arrange the column value, user and timestamp in a custom format. Below is the sample value for custom format: @{UserName} – Created: {Created} \\r\\n Columnvalue: {ColumnValue} Example : $getcolumnvalueforversion(WorkLog,All,LastToFirst,@{UserName} – Created: {Created} \\r\\n Value: {ColumnValue}) Only the below placeholders are supported in this option: {UserName} : Name of the user who saved the item with the column value. {Created} : Date and time when the version was created. {ColumnValue} : Text value of the column. textType: This is an optional parameter. It is required in “Post Adaptive Card” action as plain text value appears better in the adaptive cards used in NITRO bots. This parameter supports “Plain” and “Normal” values. Plain : Returns th"

It also provides a host of features to do operations on list items. The data shown in list view can be customized using JavaScript code. This is for advanced scenarios like data filtering that cannot be done with CAML queries or SharePoint views. Or to show item data in a format different from what is stored in the list. Detailed Instructions Users can customize the list view using JavaScript code in NITRO List View configuration. To customize the list view, go to the Site -> Site Settings -> Crow Canyon List View -> Edit the list view configuration -> Navigate to Advanced Settings -> Configure custom script in “Customize List View JavaScript Code” section as shown below: NITRO list view has below functions in custom JavaScript. GetColumnsToFetch Use this function to fetch data for any columns in addition to columns in the configured list view. These column values can be used in other functions like “UpdateListItemsValues” and “UpdateListItemValues”. Ex : scriptManager.GetColumnsToFetch = function(viewColumns, viewName, objListView){ var loadColumnNames = [\"CaseId\",\"Requester\",\"AssignedStaff\"]; return loadColumnNames; }; In above example, “CaseId”, “Requester”, and “AssignedStaff” are the column internal names in the list. viewColumns : This parameter has the column names from the configured list view. viewName : This parameter has the current view name in case of multiple list views configured in the list view settings. objListView : This parameter has the JavaScript object representing the NITRO list view, it can be used in some advanced scenarios. UpdateListItemsValues This function will be called after fetching data for the view configured in the list view. This function can be used to modify list item column values before this data is processed to render the list view. Ex : scriptManager.UpdateListItemsValues = function(listItems, viewName, objListView){ return listItems; }; listItems : This parameter has data for all items in the specified view. UpdateListItemValues This function will be called after fetching items for the view configured in the list view. This function can be used to modify list column values before this data is processed to render the list view. This function is called for each item in the list view. Note : Use this function (UpdateListItemValues) or UpdateListItemsValues. There should not be a case to use both. Former is called for each item separately, latter is called only once with all the values. Ex : scriptManager.UpdateListItemValues = function(listItem, viewName, objListView){ return listItem; }; listItem : This parameter has the data for the list item that can be modified. IsItemVisible This function can be used to decide whether to show the item in the list view or not. This function can be used for advanced filtering that is not possible with CAML queries. This function will be called for each item in the list view. Ex : scriptManager.IsItemVisible = function(listItem, viewName, objListView){ return true; }; Sample Use Cases Below sample use case are configured in NITRO list view using custom JavaScript. Use case 1: Format Crow Canyon List View to show custom generated unique Id This sample use case uses the “scriptManager.UpdateListItemsValues” function in the custom JavaScript. In list column there is a number value. Script code formats the number based on data in item and the formatted value is shown in list view instead of just the number value. Note that this does not update the data stored in the list, it is only to display in the list view. Details: NITRO list view is configured on Tickets list, and it has below columns in the list views. Title CaseId Category Issue Type Requester Priority Status Type of Ticket NITRO List View is configured with three views and list view is added to a page. Unassigned Tickets All Open Tickets All Items “Case Id” column in Tickets list has the value of SharePoint generated unique ID (number). Each item has a unique value for this column. In this sample use case, we have configured custom script to show the “Case Id” column value as an alpha-numeric Id. For many business scenarios, it is required to have an alpha-numeric Id. For example: INC_00001 instead of just 1. Note that using NITRO Id column or NITRO Workflows, formatted value can be saved in columns. However, here we are taking the scenario where stored value is just a number but while displaying it needs to be a formatted value. This case Id is constructed based on values in the list item column “Type of Ticket” and the SharePoint generated item Id. “Type of Ticket” has two options Incident Request If “Type of Ticket” is “"

This can be used in scenarios where new users need to be created in on-boarding type of flows. SharePoint application site will have a list with details of the user like name, email, telephone number, and other attributes. Workflow will read these attributes and connect to Azure AD to create the user. For more details regarding Invoke Web Service action in NITRO Workflows, please refer to this article . Pre-requisites: User should be an administrator of O365 subscription. Should have full control permissions on the SharePoint site where workflow is to be configured. Summary of Steps App Registration in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Create a new app registration. Grant API permissions. Generate client secret. Configuration of NITRO Workflow Detailed Steps App Registration in Azure Active Directory Azure AD app is needed to get the required access to create the user in AD. App credentials are stored as part of workflow settings in your SharePoint site and Crow Canyon does not have access to this information. Create new app registration in Azure AD Go to Office 365 Admin Center -> Azure Active Directory -> App Registrations -> New Registration Direct URL: https://aad.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps For more details regarding app registration in Azure AD, please refer to this article: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app Copy Client Id and Tenant Id after registering the App as shown in image below. These will be used later in the NITRO Workflow. Grant API Permissions As shown in image above, click “API Permissions” link. Click Add a permission -> Microsoft Graph -> Application Permissions -> Add below permission levels for “Delegated” and “Application” type of permissions. User.ReadWrite.All Directory.ReadWrite.All After adding permissions, click ‘Grant admin consent for ‘ Generate the client secret Go to Certificates and secrets -> New client secret -> Add a client secret. You can give any description for the secret. Select the appropriate expiry duration for the certificate. Secret will need to be regenerated after expiry and workflow needs to be updated with new secret. After adding client secret, copy the client secret. Configuration of NITRO Workflow Go to the site where we want to configure workflow to create user in Azure AD. Workflow is to be configured on the list that has the required user attributes information. Though workflow can be used with hard-coded values for user attributes, usually that will not be the case. S. No. Column Name Column Internal Name Description 1 First Name FirstName Specifies first name of the user 2 Last Name LastName Specifies last name of the user 3 Display Name DisplayName Specifies display name of the user 4 Email Email Specifies email address of the user 5 Phone Phone Specifies mobile phone number of the user 6 Department Department Specifies department of the user Go to Site Settings -> Crow Canyon NITRO Apps -> NITRO Workflows and configure the workflow as shown below: Action1: Get Access Token Configure invoke web service action to get access token as shown below: URL : https://login.microsoftonline.com/{{tenantId}}/OAuth2/V2.0/token In the above URL, replace “{{tenantId}}” with your tenant id that was copied in “Create new app registration” section above.

Width can be adjusted by using “Column Width JSON” option in List View Advanced Settings. If column header text is more than the available width, then it is truncated to fit the width. This article describes the steps to adjust the column width and the text overflow styles in column headers. Detailed Instructions Column Width To adjust the column width, go to the SharePoint Site -> Site Settings -> Crow Canyon List View -> Edit the required list view setting -> Navigate to Advanced Settings -> Column Width JSON and configure the column width as per the requirement. Ex : JSON used in above : { \"LinkTitle\":{ \"width\":250 }, \"Title\":{ \"width\":150 }, \"ID\":{ \"width\":80 }, \"RequestedShipmentDate\":{ \"width\":200 }, \"MitigationOrRollbackOptions\":{ \"width\":200 }, \"Status\":{ \"width\":100 }, \"Priority\":{ \"width\":100 } } In above JSON, we have configured column width for below columns: Title RequestedShipmentDate MitigationOrRollbackOptions Status Priority Note : Specify column internal names and not the display names of the columns in the JSON. To find the column internal names, please refer to this article . If any of the columns is not specified in the JSON, then it will get default width as per the data type of the column. If the total width for the columns is more than the available width for the list view webpart, then horizontal scroll will become visible. Sample output: Before applying column width: After applying column width: TextOverflow If the column header is more than the width of the column, then the column header will be truncated by default in NITRO List Views. In advanced settings, for header style, ‘TextOverflow’ can be set to “Wrap” or “Truncate” for column header text overflow cases. To apply these styles, go to the site -> Site Settings -> Crow Canyon List View -> Edit the list view -> Navigate to Advanced Settings -> Extended Settings JSON -> Configure the column header text overflow behavior as shown below: Sample output with “Truncate” : Sample output with “Wrap” : About supportTeam View all posts by supportTeam → © 2025 Crow Canyon Systems, Inc.

Description Crow Canyon Service Request application by default comes with below status options in Ticket’s list. SharePoint Online : Unassigned Assigned Resolved Closed SharePoint On-premises : Not Started In Progress Resolved Closed These status options can be modified as per our requirement using state management feature in service request applications. This article describes the instructions to configure state management in Crow Canyon service request applications. Summary of steps : List Schema Configuration of State Management Sample Use Cases Detailed Instructions: 1.List Schema 1.Make sure that “State Management” column exist in “Configuration” list. If not, create the column. Go to Site Contents -> Configurations list -> Create column as given below: Column : State Management Internal name : StateManagement Display name : State Management Column type : Multiple lines of plain text 2. Add “State Management” column to NITRO forms. Go to Configuration list -> List Settings -> Crow Canyon NITRO Forms and add “State Management” column to the form and publish the forms. 2.Configuration of State Management Go to Application Administration -> General Configurations and configure below JSON in the “State Management” column. JSON : { \"Unassigned\": { \"DisplayName\": \"Not Started\", \"AutoSetOnStaffClear\": \"Yes\" }, \"Assigned\": { \"DisplayName\": \"In Progress\", \"AutoSetOnAssign\": \"Yes\", \"SetFirstAssignedDate\": \"No\" }, \"Resolved\": { \"DisplayName\": \"Resolved\" }, \"Closed\": { \"DisplayName\": \"Completed\" } } Note : Do not modify the keys “Unassigned”, “Assigned”, “Resolved” and “Closed” in above JSON. In above Json: Properties : DisplayName : This property represents the updated status value of ‘Unassigned’ option in Ticket’s list. Ex: If we would like to update the status of ‘Unassigned’ to ‘Not Started’, we can use the ‘DisplayName’ for ‘Unassigned’ as ‘Not Started’. Similarly, we can modify the status of other options i.e., ‘Assigned’, ‘Resolved’ and ‘Closed’ as per our requirement. AutoSetOnStaffClear : Out of the box, when ‘Assigned Staff’ is cleared from Ticket, system will automatically reset the status to initial state i.e. Unassigned. If we would like to override this behavior, set ‘AutoSetOnStaffClear’ property value to ‘No’ in ‘State Management’. AutoSetOnAssign : Out of the box, when ‘Assigned Staff’ filled in a Ticket, system will automatically modify the status to ‘Assigned’. If we would like to override this behavior, set ‘AutoSetOnAssign’ property value to ‘No’ in ‘State Management’. SetFirstAssignedDate : Out of the box, when a Ticket is assigned/reassigned, ‘Assigned Date’ will always updated with latest assignment date. If we would like to capture the first assignment date in Ticket’s list, set this property to ‘Yes’. Note : Please make sure that ‘First Assignment Date’ column is there in the Tickets list. If not, please create this column. Column : First Assignment Date Internal name : FirstAssignmentDate Display name : First Assignment Date Column type : Multiple lines of plain text 3. Sample Use Case In this sample use case, we would like to use new status options instead of ‘Unassigned’, ‘Assigned’ and ‘Closed’. Below table describes the current status options and the corresponding new status options. Current Status Option New Status Option Unassigned New Assigned Work in progress Resolved Resolved Closed Completed Instructions 1. Modify the ‘Request Status’ options in Ticket’s list and Archived Ticket’s lists. Go to the list -> List Settings -> Edit ‘Request Status’ column and add new status options. 2. Go to Application Administration -> General Configurations -> Add below JSON in ‘State Management’ column. Note : If there is any list view using these status options, then we need to update the list views. State Management : { \"Unassigned\": { \"DisplayName\": \"New\", \"AutoSetOnStaffClear\": \"Yes\" }, \"Assigned\": { \"DisplayName\": \"Work in progress\", \"AutoSetOnAssign\": \"Yes\", \"SetFirstAssignedDate\": \"Yes\" }, \"Resolved\": { \"DisplayName\": \"Resolved\" }, \"Closed\": { \"DisplayName\": \"Completed\" } } After configuring new status options in Ticket’s list, we need to modify these new status options in different places in the application. Tickets and Archived Tickets list views Go to the Tickets and Archived Tickets list -> List Settings -> Edit the list views and modify the status options as per new statuses. Modify the status options in ‘Mark Closed’ and ‘Re-open’ submit actions in portal Ticket forms in Ticket’s list. Go to Tickets list -> List Settings -> Crow Canyon NITRO Forms -> Edit ‘PortalTicket’ forms -> Switch to edit form -> Select ‘Mark Closed’ and ‘Re-open’ submit actions -> Edit the script in submit a"

    "text": " Query List (Search) action configurations in NITRO Custom Actions Query List (Search) action configurations in NITRO Custom Actions 788 views 4 min , 45 sec read 0 Applies to : SharePoint Online and On-Premises Introduction Query List action is used to fetch the items meeting the required filter criteria and then do some action on those items. For example, we can fetch tasks that are ‘Open’ and are of a particular ‘Type’ and then send a reminder mail to assignee of each task. The filter conditions are specified in the Custom Action settings and cannot be changed during execution. More details on this action are here: https://www.crowcanyon.help/article/470/ ‘Query list (Search)’ action allows user to specify the search text and select the required items when custom action is executed. User selected items can then be processed in subsequent actions like normal Query List action. Detailed Description Search Type Select the search type to fetch the items from the list: NITRO Search : Uses CAML query to search the matching items from SharePoint list. It uses both the conditions specified in ‘Filter Items By’ option and the user entered text. SharePoint Search : This will search on indexed content to find the relevant matching items. For large lists, this can give better results. Both : User will have the option to select the search type during action execution. Selection Type Whether to get a single item or a collection of items. This depends on the business use case. Select Query Site URL Select the site of the list from which items have to be fetched. Items can be fetched from any site within the site collection. Based on site selection, next drop-down for the lists will be populated. Query List Select list from which items have to be fetched. Please note that next option depend on this selection. Filter Items By List View Fetch items from the list selected in the ‘Query List’ option based on the selected ‘List View’. Items will be fetched based on the conditions specified in the list view conditions and the search text entered by the user. Query Builder Fetch items from the list selected in the ‘Query List’ option based on the conditions specified in the Query Builder and the search text entered by the user. Column placeholder syntax in the conditions: %%[Column Display Name|Column Internal Name]%% Ex: %%[ID|ID]%% For more details about the syntax used in query list action, refer to this article . Query Fetch items from the list selected in the ‘Query List’ option based on the specified CAML query and the search text entered by the user. Please refer CAML query syntax from this article . Sample CAML query : <View> <Query> <Where> <Eq> <FieldRef Name='RelatedItems' LookupId='TRUE'/> <Value Type='Lookup'>%%[ID|ID])%%</Value> </Eq> </Where> </Query> </View> Item Selection Mandatory Whether selecting one or more items from search result is mandatory for the user to continue Custom Action execution. Continue Custom Action Execution This option can be used to continue or stop the execution of the Custom Action based on whether items are selected in the Query List search result or not. Always : This is the default option and execution of subsequent actions is not dependent on whether any items are selected in the Query List search results or not. Only if item(s) selected : This option will continue the custom action execution flow only when one or more items are selected in the Query list action. This is used in common scenario where we are fetching items using Query List search action and then there is an Update Item action to update all the items selected from the query list search results. If there are no items selected in Query List search results, then it is not required to run the action to update them. However, note that if there are any other actions after Update Item action then those too will be skipped. Hence, use this option if all subsequent actions should be skipped if no items are selected in Query List Search action. Only if no item selected: This option will continue the custom action execution flow only when no items are selected from the Query List search action. Note : All subsequent actions will be skipped if execution is stopped at the Query List action. Grid Settings Search result selection limit Specify the number of items user can select from the search results. The maximum number of items a user can select is 500. Display Columns Select the columns to be shown in the search results grid. First sort by the column Select the column to sort the items in search results. Items Per Page Limit Specify the number of items to be displayed per page in the search results. Variable mappings Configure variables to update the query list search results. Follow below syntax to update the variable value with Query list search results for single item and item collection.

If syntax is invalid, then all settings will get cleared. Hide command bar in list view webpart By default, NITRO list view webpart will show the command bar and that will have different action buttons like New, Email, Custom Actions etc. We can show or hide the command bar using ‘CommandBar’ property in ‘Extended Settings’. Set “CommandBar” property ‘hide’ to ‘true’ as shown below to hide the command bar. With command bar: Without command bar: Apply background color for command bar: We can apply background colour for ‘Command bar’ in ‘Extended Settings’ as shown below: Example: “CommandBar”: {“BackgroundColor”:”lightslategrey”} For html color names, refer to this article . Vertical padding for header and footer We can adjust the padding for ‘Header’ and ‘Footer’ in list view using ‘VerticalPadding’ settings in ‘Header’ and ‘Footer’ styles in ‘Extended Settings’. Sample output for ‘Header’ and ‘Footer’ after applying vertical padding. Compared to earlier images in this article, there is more space above and below the text in header and footer. Apply prefix for Toolbar text: This setting will be applied only when the list view ‘Toolbar Mode’ is selected as ‘Compact’ instead of ‘Standard’.

NITRO Forms: Set column values back to the original if any validation fails during save. 718 views 1 min , 43 sec read 0 Applies to: SharePoint online and On-premises (2013, 2016, 2019 and SE) Description: NITRO Forms provides enhanced capabilities to create, view or modify the SharePoint list items. For any specific cases not covered directly by the configurations, custom JavaScript can be added using ‘Submit Action’ and ‘Script Action’ in NITRO Forms. For more details about ‘Submit Action’ and ‘Script Action’, refer to this article . On ‘Submit Action’ button click, we can set column values on the form using custom JavaScript. For example, a form may have two buttons – ‘Submit for Approval’ and the normal ‘Save’ button. On clicking ‘Submit for Approval’ button, ‘Approval Status’ column value can be automatically set to the ‘Pending Approval’ status. This way user need not manually set the value and as per the action taken one or more column values can be auto-set. However, if any validation fails then form will not be submitted, and user will need to modify the form data before submitting again. In this case, the column values that were set with custom JavaScript will not get reverted to original values. For example, if user clicked ‘Submit for Approval’ button the script will set the status. In case of any validation failure, user may decide to just save the item as draft and come back later for approval submission. In this case, it is necessary to revert the ‘Approval Status’ column value as it should not remain as ‘Pending Approval’. This article describes the instructions to revert column values on the form if any validation fails after clicking submit action button. Detailed Description This article uses ‘Requests’ list and it has below columns: Column Name Column Internal Name Column Type Title Title Single line of text Request Status RequestStatus Choice type of column Options: UnassignedAssignedResolvedClosed Resolution Resolution Multiple lines of plain text Assigned Staff AssignedStaff Person or Group Requester Requester Person or Group Process Log Process Log Multiple lines of plain text Configure validation on ‘Resolution’ column to make this column as required if “Request Status” is set to “Resolved”. Configure a submit action ‘Resolve’ on the form, this will set the ‘Request Status’ to ‘Resolved’ and if any validation fails then it will set the ‘Request Status’ column value back to its original value. Instructions Configure validation on ‘Resolution’ column. Go to the list à List Settings à Crow Canyon NITRO Forms à Select the ‘Resolution’ column à Configure the column validation in ‘Column Settings’ as shown below: Apply the Column Settings. Configure ‘Resolve’ submit actions as shown below. This button will be shown in edit form, and it will set the ‘Request Status’ to ‘Resolved’. If any validation fails, then it will revert the ‘Request Status’ column to its original value. Expand ‘Actions’ section from left hand panel and drag and drop ‘Submit Action’ on to the form. Configure submit action as shown below: Pre-Save script used above var currentStatus = currentItem.get_item(\"RequestStatus\"); formContext.setColumnControlValueByName(\"RequestStatus\", \"Resolved\"); var listColumnValueobj = {}; var advSettings = { Validate : true, Fail: function(){ formContext.setColumnControlValueByName(\"RequestStatus\", currentStatus); }}; listColumnValueobj[\"ProcessLog\"] = \"Request is resolved.\"; functionCallback(false, listColumnValueobj, \"Default\", advSettings) Apply the settings and publish the form. Sample Output: If validation is successful: Clicking ‘Resolve’ button will set the ‘Request Status’ column value to ‘Resolved’ and item will be saved.

NITRO Studio pages are not opening in migrated sites Issue : In sites that have been migrated, NITRO Studio pages shows message ‘An unexpected error has occurred’. Cause : This issue can occur if the site collection Id is changed as part of the migration process (site is moved to current location from another environment). When site is restored using SharePoint content database backup/restore method, site collection id, site Id etc. are not changed. However, for other methods (custom migration tool, site collection backup/restore) to restore the site collection, site collection Id can change. Since NITRO Studio works with Ids of the sites, this issue will occur if Ids change for a site that is using NITRO Studio. Resolution : There are two hidden lists in the root site of the site collection (”CrowCanyonNITROInfo” and “CrowCanyonAddinInfo”). These lists are used by NITRO Studio, and they have items referring to site collection Ids. Delete all the items in these two lists after the site collection is restored to target environment. After deleting the items, navigate to ‘Crow Canyon NITRO Studio App’ page in the site and refresh the page once, this will create the entries in hidden lists in the root site of the site collection (”CrowCanyonNITROInfo” and “CrowCanyonAddinInfo”).

These actions can be invoked: On form load. On a column value change. By user clicking on a button on the form (‘Execute Manually’). For sample use cases of form event actions on form load and on column value change, refer to below articles: Use ‘Form Event Actions’ feature of NITRO Forms to add custom functionality Use ‘Form Event Actions’ Feature Of NITRO Forms To Add Custom Functionality – II This article describes the use of manually executed form event actions in NITRO Forms. Example scenario Set ‘Due Date’ column value on the form based on some data on the form and some calculation. For example, ‘Today’ or some date column on the form plus 5 days. In some scenarios, this will be done automatically when a column value is changed on the form. Like user may set the priority and based on that due date is automatically calculated (using form event actions on column value change). In other cases, user will review the data on form and then decide to do an action. There could be more than one button on the form and user will click the required button to invoke the appropriate form event action. This is the case for manually invoked actions that will perform the required changes on the form. Buttons are of two types. Script action buttons are used to execute the required script or form event action and after that user can continue editing the form. Submit buttons also do the same but save the item after running the script/action. For more details about the action buttons, refer to this article: https://www.crowcanyon.info/nitro/appmanual_v2/actions.html Detailed Description We can execute form event actions that are set to ‘Execute Manually’ using ‘Script Action’ and ‘Submit Action’ buttons in new and edit forms. Script Action: Configure script action button on the form. Refer to images below. Go to NITRO Forms Designer for the list à Expand ‘Actions’ section à Drag and drop ‘Script Action’ button on the form. From button settings in right-hand panel, click ‘Edit’ button for process à Select ‘Form Event Action’ in the ‘Process’ dialog à Select the required form event action from ‘Execute Action’ drop-down. This drop-down shows all those form event actions that are selected to execute manually. Submit Action Configure submit action button on the form. Refer to images below. Go to NITRO Forms Designer for the list à Expand ‘Actions’ section à Drag and drop ‘Submit Action’ on the form. à From button settings in right-hand panel, click ‘Edit’ button for pre-save process à Select ‘Form Event Action’ in ‘Pre-Save Process’ dialog à Select the required form event action from ‘Execute Pre-Save Action’ and ‘Execute Action on Validation Failure’ dropdown. These dropdowns show all the form event actions that are configured for manual execution. Sample use case: Set due date column value as 5 business days from ‘today’ on a Ticket form. Sample list schema and use case: Standard SharePoint list Due Date: Date and Time column Set ‘Due Date’ column value 5 business days from ‘today’. Instructions: Configure a form event action as shown below: ‘Configure Column mapping for ‘Due Date’ column in ‘Tickets’ list: After configuring the form event action, drag and drop ‘Submit Action’ button on to the form and invoke ‘Set Due Date’ form event action in the submit action pre-save script. After configuring the submit action button, click ‘Submit’ action button on the form to execute the form event action. This will set the ‘Due Date’ column value before item is saved. If there is chance that the form submit (item save) will fail due to validations on some column values, you can configure another manual form event action. In that action ‘Due Date’ value can be cleared. This is for scenarios where user will just ‘save’ the item and not ‘submit’ it after the data validation error. And in that case the form should not have a due date set. Select the action to clear the due date in drop-down “Execute Action On Validation Failure”.

    "text": " Manual for DocuSign Action Manual for DocuSign Action 610 views 4 min , 56 sec read 0 Applies to : SharePoint Online and On-premises NITRO Workflows Introduction DocuSign is an electronic signature platform that simplifies and accelerates the document signing process. It allows users to securely sign, send, and manage documents online, eliminating the need for physical paperwork. DocuSign action in NITRO Workflows is used to send documents within the NITRO sites for signing. Signing process can be tracked and signed documents can be stored in a separate document library. Installation SharePoint Online It is installed as part of NITRO Studio and no separate steps are required. SharePoint On-Premises : Go to SharePoint Central Administration -> Monitoring -> Review Job Definitions and ensure below timer job is created for DocuSign. Note : Ignore this step if timer job already exists for the site collection. If this timer job is not created, please deactivate ‘Crow Canyon Mail Templates Administration’ feature and activate again. Follow below instructions: Open SharePoint Management Shell in SharePoint server (run as administration) and run below commands. Feature Name : CrowCanyonMailTemplates Deactivate feature command : Disable-SPFeature -Identity “CrowCanyonMailTemplates” -URL “SiteCollectionURL” Activate feature command: Enable-SPFeature -Identity “CrowCanyonMailTemplates” -URL “SiteCollectionURL” Detailed Description of DocuSign action Before DocuSign action can be used in NITRO Workflows, permissions need to be granted. Process to grant permissions is described below. Grant Permission NITRO application need access to user’s DocuSign account to programmatically manage the document signing process. Also known as “API consent,” it is a feature that allows applications to integrate with DocuSign’s eSignature capabilities. When a user grants permission for API access, they are authorizing a specific application to access their DocuSign account on their behalf, which can be helpful for automating document-related processes or workflows. On approval, access is granted using an access token and this process ensures the security and privacy of the user’s documents. Grant Permission process has following steps: Get the DocuSign account User Id Select the environment and grant permissions Test connection Save the settings You can find the DocuSign User Id in DocuSign Portal. Click below link: Login with your DocuSign user account -> Go to Settings in top menu -> Apps and Keys -> Copy the User ID To grant access: Go to SharePoint Site Settings page -> Crow Canyon NITRO Site Settings -> DocuSign API Connection Settings. Refer to below image to grant permissions. Select the environment as ‘Production’. ‘Developer’ environment is only for development and testing purpose. Click ‘Grant Permission’ button and use your DocuSign account to login and grant permissions. Enter your DocuSign User ID copied above and click ‘Test Connection’ button. If connection is successful, then save the settings. Configuration of DocuSign action in NITRO Workflows Go to SharePoint Site Settings -> Crow Canyon NITRO Apps -> NITRO Workflows DocuSign action has two parts: First part is used to send the document for signing. This includes the document and the users who need to sign. General Settings Action Name : Provide a name for the action. Action Description: Provide a short description for the action. Delay Execution: Provide time in seconds to delay action execution if required. Select Document: This section explains from where to select the document that need the signature. Document to sign: Item Attachment/Document: Attachment file of the SharePoint list item on which workflow is being executed. Document of the document library item on which workflow is being executed. Generate Document Action: File that is generated via a generate document action in the same workflow. Item Attachment/Document: If DocuSign action is configured on a custom list, then fetch the attachment file from current item.  Attachment Name option will be visible in this case. Attachment Name:Provide attachment name/placeholder to select the required document. Keeping ‘Attachment Name’ blank will fetch the first attachment of the item for document signing. If DocuSign action is configured on document library, this will fetch document on which workflows is being executed. Attachment Name option will not be visible in this case as a document library item has a single file only. Generate Document Action: Workflow can have one or more actions of type ‘Generate Document Action’. The generated document can be sent for signing. Select the required action in drop-down for this option. Note that generate document action should be prior to the signing action in the workflow. Note: This action supports only a single document for signing. Recipients:        This section describes the users who will receive the document for signing.

And user can configure different NITRO forms for each content type. A SharePoint list item can be created with one content type and can later be updated to a different content type. To open the item in NITRO form for the updated content type, we need to update a hidden column value in item that stores the NITRO form key. This document describes the multiple content types in SharePoint lists and steps to update content type and form key for an item. Steps to add content types to SharePoint List Go to List settings -> Advanced settings -> select ‘yes’ in Allow management of content types -> click Ok 2. Go to List settings -> In Content types click ‘add from existing site content types’ Select content types as shown below: For example: In ‘Tickets’ list below content types are added 3. Configure a different NITRO form for each content type. To create new form Go to ‘Manage Forms’ in NITRO Forms ribbon Click ‘New form’ button In the ‘Configure NITRO Form’ window: Select Form Name If you want to copy the new form from an existing form, then select the required form in dropdown. Click ‘Ok’ Click ‘Edit’ to configure form setting. Below images shows NITRO form for ‘Category’ content type in ‘Tickets’ list. Click ‘Publish’ button to publish the form. After configuring NITRO form, bind it with specific content type as described in below step. 4. To bind NITRO form to a specific content type, go to Advanced settings of ‘Manage Forms’ in NITRO Forms ribbon. 5. Click ‘New Mapping’ in ‘Configure Content Type Mappings’ Click ‘Ok’ to save the settings. In List, to create items with different content types Go to list -> ‘New’ button dropdown will show all available content types Select content type for which you want to create item, NITRO form configured for that content type will open. To open item with specific form Go to Advanced settings of ‘Manage Forms’ in NITRO Forms ribbon. 2. Click ‘New Setting’ in ‘Configure Override Forms’ With above override forms setting, items created with ‘Tickets’ form will open with Category form. Similarly, you can configure other override forms settings as per requirement. Steps to open NITRO form of an item with specific form key When an item is created using NITRO Forms, the NITOR form name (form key) is saved in a hidden column (‘CCSPortalFormKey’). When an item is opened, this value is used to decide which NITRO form to use to display the item content. To open an item with a different form, it is required to update item content type along with ‘CCSPortalFormKey’ column value and specify the form key with which we want to open that item.  Below are the steps to update item content type and ‘CCSPortalFormKey’ column value using Crow    Canyon Custom Actions. If item content type is updated for any reason, then ‘CCSPortalFormKey’ value should be updated as well. Below steps explain updating both the content type and the ‘CCSPortalFormKey’ for an item. Sample List: ‘Tickets’ In this example, we are updating the item content type to ‘Category’ and ‘CCSPortalFormKey’ to ‘Category’ form key. Navigate to the ‘Tickets’ list à Custom Actions (from list ribbon) à Configure a new action. Action 1: Add ‘Update List Item’ action on to the canvas. This action is to update the content type. Action 2: Add ‘Execute Script’ action on to the canvas. This action is to update the form key. Publish the custom action  Script to update form key: currentItem.set_item(“CCSPortalFormKey”,”Category”); currentItem.update(); spContext.executeQueryAsync(functionCallback,functionCallback); functionCallback(); Sample input: Item has ‘Item’ content type and below NITRO form is configured for ‘Item’ content type.

This scenario can also be used to include validation for the number of attachments and is explained below. The script used in this article is tied to a ‘Submit Action’ button and can be found for reference within the explained steps. Detailed Steps Navigate to the desired list where the total attachments need to be counted and open the NITRO Forms for this list. Add the required columns of the list in the NITRO Forms designer page. To count the total attachments and populate this value to a specific column, create a new column (For example, a single line of text column) and provide it a name. In this example, we have used a ‘Single line of text’ column that has been named as ‘Docs’ (this name can be changed as per the requirement), and this column’s internal name is only used in the script. Then drag and drop a ‘Submit Action’ button present under ‘Actions’ tab as shown below: The default ‘Save’ button can be hidden by selecting ‘Hide Save Button’ option present under the Layouts and Theme -> Buttons as shown below: Once the Submit Action button is added, click on the ‘Edit’ button present adjacent to the ‘Pre-Save Process’ option and use the below script as shown below: Script used above: var attachcount = (window.ccs_g_FormUI.fetchAttachments() || []).length; formContext.setColumnControlValueByName(\"Docs\",attachcount); functionCallback(); This script would count the total number of attachments for any newly created item in the list as well as during the editing of the pre-existing item in the list and on submitting the form, it would display the total number of attachments in the ‘Docs’ column. Publish the NITRO Form to check the result. A sample output generated from the list configured with above mentioned steps is as shown below: The attached files can also be restricted using validations in attachment settings as shown below: Click on ‘Add’ to configure a new validation. In this example scenario, we are setting the maximum attachments limit to 2 for the default SharePoint Attachments column as shown below: If a user tries to attach more than 2 files (as specified in the above scenario) either in NITRO Attachments column or in the default SharePoint column, a message will appear as shown below: Script to count only the NITRO Attachments column: If there is a requirement to count the number of attachments in a NITRO Attachments column and not the total attachments in the list item, we can modify the script as shown below: In this example, we have used the name ‘NITRO Attachments’ for NITRO Attachments column. This name can also be changed as per the requirement. Script used above: var objNITROAttachment = formContext.fetchColumnValueUI(\"NITROAttachments\").split(/[\\s;]+/); if(objNITROAttachment && objNITROAttachment.length > 0){ formContext.setColumnControlValueByName(\"Docs\",objNITROAttachment.length); } functionCallback(); The Docs column has count of files in the NITRO Attachments column only: About supportTeam View all posts by supportTeam → © 2025 Crow Canyon Systems, Inc.

When an item is added to a list, Product workflows update the ‘Case ID’ and other hidden columns in the list item. If there are items added with attachments, one more update happens to set attachments after an item is created. If there is a workflow that is also updating the item on creation, it is expected that these updates happen concurrently causing version conflicts in the workflow execution. Resolution: We can follow one of the below methods to avoid these errors: 1. Delay the execution of the NITRO Workflow: Execution of a NITRO Workflow can be delayed by specifying the time in seconds in the ‘Delay Execution’ field available in the NITRO Workflow settings page as shown in the below screenshot. On using this option, the product workflow will update the item and then this NITRO workflow will start its execution. Hence, this will avoid the version conflict error(s). 2. Configuring a timer-based workflow: A timer-based workflow can be configured based on the ‘Created’ column with similar actions as that of current workflow(s). By using such a workflow, the item gets updated with a slight delay instead of updating directly on its creation. Note: There could be a possible maximum delay of 30 minutes as timer-based workflows run every 30 minutes. 3. Using a Submit Button: In NITRO Forms, we can use ‘Submit’ button instead of regular ‘Save’ button and use the NITRO Custom Actions to update an item after its creation. More details about configuring a Submit Action button can be found from the below article: https://www.crowcanyon.help/article/362/#Index1 We can also configure a user triggered workflow with same actions as that of the existing workflow(s). It can be invoked through the ‘Submit Button’ in NITRO Forms using Custom Actions (We can configure ‘Invoke Workflow’ action in custom actions to invoke the user-triggered NITRO Workflows). More details on how to invoke a workflow can be found from the below manual: https://www.crowcanyon.info/nitro/appmanual_v2/index.html?invoke-workflow.html About supportTeam View all posts by supportTeam → © 2025 Crow Canyon Systems, Inc.

NITRO API (tenant level) Tenant administrator needs to grant this permission. NITRO API will have full control permissions on all site collections in the SharePoint. This option makes the NITRO Studio installation and updates easier. 2. NITRO Site API (site.selected) Tenant administrator need to allow NITRO Site API in the tenant. This step does not grant permissions on any of the site collections. When NITRO is installed in any of the site collections, NITRO Site API will get full control permissions on that site collection only. Difference between NITRO API and NITRO Site API : NITRO API (tenant level) NITRO Site API (site.selected) It will have full control permission on all site collections. It will have full control permission on only those site collections where NITRO Studio is installed. Custom script can be enabled automatically using this permission level. Scripting is required for certain steps like adding links to NITRO in the site. Custom script cannot be enabled automatically. SharePoint administrator need to enable it manually. All site collections will be shown on the NITRO studio installation page. User can find the required site collection and initiate installation. Only those site collections where NITRO Studio is installed are shown. To add NITRO to a new site collection, user need to enter the URL of the site collection. Select the permission option as per your organization policies. Refer to this article to install NITRO Studio and activate NITRO for a site. Permissions required for different API’s : Crow Canyon Authentication API (with NITRO API) This API is required for logging into NITRO Studio installation home page: https://crowcanyonnitro.azurewebsites.net   Basic permissions only – User.Read, OpenId profile. Normal users can grant permissions for themselves.   Administrator can grant permission for entire organization.   Crow Canyon Authentication API (with NITRO Site API) This API is required for logging into NITRO Studio installation home page: https://crowcanyonnitro.azurewebsites.net   Delegated permissions – Full control on all site collections. Note that this does not allow NITRO applications to access the sites. It is only used on this site to enable ‘NITRO Site API’ permissions on the site collection where NITRO Studio is installed.   NITRO API Note: Either ‘NITRO API’ or ‘NITRO Site API’ can be used for NITRO Studio installation. Please refer to this article for installation steps. Full control permissions on all SharePoint site collections   Term store and user read permissions   NITRO Site API Full control permissions only on the site collections where NITRO Studio is installed   Term store and user read permissions   Crow Canyon Advanced Approval/NITRO Workflows/Product App Full control permissions on the site collection where NITRO Studio is installed. This is same as NITRO Site API permission.   SharePoint list items are created/updated in the context of these Apps. With separate permissions we can identify which app has created/updated the list item.   Crow Canyon Email API Mail read/write/send permissions on specific mailboxes that are used to send or receive emails in the application.   Permissions are restricted to specific mailboxes with an additional step using PowerShell.   Crow Canyon Calendar API Calendar read/write/send permissions on specific mailboxes.

The steps explained in this article can also be followed to configure the same functionality for any other list. Automatic archival process The automatic archival process moves the tickets along with their associated items like tasks, etc. to a different list without breaking their relation using NITRO Workflows. Summary of steps Prepare the list schema so that old tickets/items can be moved along with their related items. Configure NITRO Workflows to move the tickets. Detailed Steps: Prepare list schema: Save the following lists as template: Tickets, Email Tickets, Associated Tasks and Time Tracking. To save ‘Tickets’ list as template, navigate to the site -> Application Administration -> Click ‘Advanced’ -> Configure Lists -> ‘Configure Tickets’. From the Tickets list settings page, under ‘Permissions and Management’ section, click ‘Save list as template’ as shown below: 3. Provide the ‘File name’, ‘Template name’ and do not select the ‘Include Content’ option -> Click OK as shown below: 4. Similarly, save the other lists as template that are mentioned in #1 as ‘Archived Email Tickets’, ‘Archived Time Tracking’ and ‘Archived Associated Tasks’ respectively. 5. Create new archival lists from the above list templates. 6. To create ‘Archived Tickets’ list, navigate to ‘Site Contents’ -> Click ‘Return to classic SharePoint’ at the bottom left of the page (if the site is in modern experience) as shown below: 7. On the opened page, click ‘add an app’ -> Search for ‘Archived Tickets’ list template created in #3 above -> Click ‘Archived Tickets’ -> Create a list with this template as shown below: 8. Similarly, create ‘Archived Email Tickets’, ‘Archived Time Tracking’ and Archived Associated Tasks’ lists from the respective list templates. Note: The idea behind creating Archived Email Tickets, Archived Time Tracking and Archived Associated Tasks lists is to move email history and related items along with the Tickets during archival process. 9. Configure NITRO Forms for each of these archival lists using ‘Export and Import’ feature of the NITRO Forms. More information on how to use the export and import functionality of the NITRO Forms can be found in this article . 10. After creating all the archival lists and NITRO Forms, ensure that all the lookup columns in Archived Tickets list, Archived Email Tickets list, Archived Time Tracking list and Archived Associated Tasks list are correct. 11. Recreate below lookup column in archival lists: Archived Email Tickets, Archived Time Tracking and Archived Associated Tasks lists. For Archived Email Tickets list: Navigate to NITRO Forms designer for the list -> Create a NITRO Lookup column ‘Related Ticket ID’ as shown below: Internal name: RelatedTicketID Display name: Related Ticket ID For Archived Time Tracking list: Navigate to NITRO Forms designer for the list -> Create a NITRO Lookup column ‘Related Ticket ID’ as shown below: Internal name: RelatedTicketID Display name: Related Ticket ID For Archived Associated Tasks list: Navigate to NITRO Forms designer for the list -> Create a NITRO Lookup column ‘Related Ticket ID’ as shown below: Internal name: RelatedTicketID Display name: Related Ticket ID 12. Delete all the NITRO Associated Item columns (‘Time Tracking’, ‘Email History’ and ‘Associated Tasks’) from Archived Tickets list manually. 13. Recreate the NITRO Associated Item columns with the lookup columns created in #11. Navigate to the Archived Tickets list -> List settings -> Crow Canyon NITRO Forms -> Click ‘Create Column’ -> NITRO Associated Items Column. 14. Configure the ‘Time Tracking’ NITRO Associated Items column as shown below: Column Internal Name: TimeTracking Column Display Name: Time Tracking 15. Similarly, create ‘Associated Tasks’ and ‘Email History’ columns as shown below: For ‘Associated Tasks’: Column Internal Name: AssociatedTasks Column Display Name: Associated Tasks For ‘Email History’: Column Internal Name: EmailHistory Column Display Name: Email History 16. Drag and drop all the above NITRO Associated Items columns on to the NITRO Form under ‘Related Items’ tab. Configure NITRO Workflows: 1. Navigate to the Tickets list -> List settings -> Crow Canyon NITRO Workflow -> Click ‘New’ -> Select ‘scheduled / user / bot triggered’ event -> Click Ok as shown below: 2. Click ‘Settings’ button from the ‘WORKFLOW’ ribbon -> Configure action settings as shown below: Query builder conditions: ‘Status’ ‘equal’ ‘Closed’ ‘Closed Date’ ‘less or equal’ ‘OffsetDays:-365’ 3.

    "text": " Steps To Filter The List Items Using SharePoint Views and Calculated Columns Steps To Filter The List Items Using SharePoint Views and Calculated Columns 308 views 5 min , 24 sec read 0 Applies To: SharePoint Online and SharePoint On-Premises Description: This article describes the steps to use ‘ Calculated Columns ’ to create SharePoint Views for filtering the items of a list based upon a Date/Time column in the same list. The ‘Date/Time’ column used for reference in this article is titled ‘ ClosedDate ’. These steps can also be implemented using the default Date/Time columns in a SharePoint list like ‘Created’ and ’Modified’ or any other custom Date/Time type of a column(s). Detailed Steps: Use Case 1: Creating a filter in a SharePoint View to display items closed in the ‘Current Calendar Month’: 1. Navigate to the desired list -> List Settings -> Create Column -> Calculated -> Configure as shown below: Column Display Name : Start Of Current Month Column Internal Name : StartOfCurrentMonth This column is used to show the first day of the month based on ‘ClosedDate’ column value, and the formula used is: =DATE(YEAR(ClosedDate),MONTH(ClosedDate),1) 2. If required, uncheck the ‘Add to default view’ so that this column remains hidden from the main list and click ‘OK’ to save the configuration for this column. 3. Similarly, create another ‘Calculated’ column and configure it as shown below: Column Display Name: End Of Current Month Column Internal Name : EndOfCurrentMonth This column is used to show the last day of the month based on ‘ClosedDate’ column value, and the formula used is: =DATE(YEAR(ClosedDate),MONTH(ClosedDate)+1,1)-1 4. For this column also, if required, uncheck the ‘Add to default view’ option and click on ‘OK’ to save the column in the list. 5. Navigate back to the list and from the list ribbon, select ‘All Items’ -> Create new view as shown below: 6. Provide a name to this view. In this example, we have named it as ‘Tickets Closed In Current Month’ to display only those items in the list that are closed in the current month as shown below: Filter conditions for this view are used as: 7. Save the above view and on selecting this view, the items in the list will be displayed as shown below: Use Case 2: Creating a filter in a SharePoint View to display items closed in the ‘Previous Calendar Month’: 1. Create three ‘Calculated’ columns in the list as explained in the ‘Use Case 1’ and name them as ‘ Closed Year ’, ‘ Closed Month ’ and ‘ Is Previous Month ’ respectively. The names can be changed as per the requirement. 2. The ‘Closed Year’ column can be configured as shown below: Column Display Name : Closed Year Column Internal Name : ClosedYear This column is used to calculate the year on which the Ticket was closed based on the date entered in ‘ClosedDate’ column, and the formula used is: =YEAR(ClosedDate) 3. The ‘Closed Month’ calculated column can be configured as shown below: Column Display Name : Closed Month Column Internal Name : ClosedMonth The purpose of this column is to calculate the closed month based upon the value in the ‘ClosedDate’ column, and the formula used is: =MONTH(ClosedDate) 4. The ‘Is Previous Month’ column can be configured as shown below: Column Display Name : Is Previous Month Column Internal Name : IsPreviousMonth The formula used above is: =IF(AND(YEAR(TODAY())=YEAR(DATE(YEAR(ClosedDate),MONTH(ClosedDate)+1,0)),MONTH(ClosedDate)=MONTH(TODAY())-1),”Yes”,”No”) Example: If ClosedDate is 2023-05-15 and Today is 2023-06-13, the formula will evaluate: YEAR(TODAY()) = 2023 YEAR(DATE(YEAR(2023),MONTH(2023-05-15)+1,0)) = 2023 MONTH(2023-05-15) = 5 MONTH(2023-06-13)-1 = 5 The conditions are true, so the result will be “Yes”. If ClosedDate is 2023-04-15 and Today is 2023-06-13, the conditions will not be met, so the result will be “No”. Explanation of the formula: TODAY(): This function returns the current date. YEAR(TODAY()): This extracts the year from the current date. MONTH(TODAY()): This extracts the month from the current date. YEAR(ClosedDate): This extracts the year from the ‘ClosedDate’ column. MONTH(ClosedDate): This extracts the month from the ClosedDate. DATE(YEAR(ClosedDate), MONTH(ClosedDate) + 1, 0): This constructs a date by taking the year of ‘ClosedDate’, the month of ‘ClosedDate’ plus one, and day zero of that month. The day zero of the next month actually gives the last day of the current month. This is a used to get the last day of the month for the ‘ClosedDate’ column. YEAR(DATE(YEAR(ClosedDate), MONTH(ClosedDate) + 1, 0)): This extracts the year from the date calculated above, which is the last day of the month of the ‘ClosedDate’ column. MONTH(TODAY()) – 1: This calculates the previous month from the current date. 5. Create a new view titled ‘Tickets Closed Last Month’ as explained in #5 of Use Case 1. It can be configured as shown below: The filter conditions used for this view are: 6. Once the above configured view is saved, the output from the list d"

For this purpose, Auto-fill User Information and a Form Event Action (FEA) can be configured in NITRO Forms using the steps mentioned below. Detailed Steps: 1. Navigate to the desired list -> List Settings -> Crow Canyon NITRO Forms. 2. On the opened NITRO Forms designer page, add the required columns. For this example, the columns that are used are as follows: Requester: It is a ‘NITRO User’ column with configuration as shown below: Requester Manager: It is a  ‘NITRO User’ column with configuration same as the Requester column shown above. Requester Manager Email: A ‘Single line of text’ column will be used to autofill the Manager’s email. Requester Manager’s Manager: It is a ‘NITRO User’ column with a configuration similar to above two NITRO User columns. 3. Once all the above-configured columns have been added to the designer page of the form, navigate to the ‘Form Settings’ section at the left of the designer page, expand this section, and select ‘Auto-fill User Information’ as shown below: 4. On the opened page, select the ‘User Profile’ option for ‘Get user information from’ section and select ‘New Setting’ as shown below: 5. In the opened ‘New Setting’ window, configure the settings to autofill the ‘Requester’ column based on the value from the logged-in user as shown below: 6. On selecting ‘New Mapping’ button from the above screenshot, select the column as ‘Requester Manager’ and ‘User Property’ as ‘Other Property’ and type the field as ‘Manager’ as shown below: The purpose of this configuration is to autofill the name of the requester’s manager in the column ‘Requester Manager’ based on the current logged-in user. 7. Once the auto-fill user settings have been configured, navigate to the left of the designer page, and expand the ‘Advanced’ section -> ‘Form Event Actions’ -> ‘New Configuration’, and configure it as shown below: 8. On selecting ‘Update Form Controls’, configure the column mapping for ‘Requester Manager’s Manager’ column by selecting ‘New Mapping’ as shown below: 9. The column mapping can be configured as shown below: In the above screenshot, the function used is ‘$getspuserproperty’ and the placeholder is ‘Requester Manager’ column as shown below: The full syntax used above is: $getspuserproperty([Requester Manager|RequesterManager],manager) This configuration helps in auto populating the value for the ‘Requester Manager’s Manager’ column as soon as the value in the ‘Requester Manager’ column is populated (using the previously configured autofill settings). Note: More information about the ‘$getspuserproperty’ can be found from this article . 10. Similarly, to auto fill the ‘Requester Manager Email’ column, we can configure another column mapping in the same Form Event Action by selecting New Action -> Update Form Controls -> Provide a title for the action -> New Mapping as shown below: The full syntax is ‘$getspuserproperty([Requester Manager|RequesterManager],email)’. The configured Form Event Action with all the above mentioned settings will be as shown below: 11. Once all the above configuration is saved, publish the NITRO Forms.

    "text": " Auto-assignment in Crow Canyon helpdesk applications Auto-assignment in Crow Canyon helpdesk applications 278 views 3 min , 9 sec read 0 Applies to : Crow Canyon helpdesk applications (SharePoint Online) Description Auto-assignment refers to assigning new Tickets (or Requests) automatically to specified staff based on the configured rules. This can be done in following ways: Based on the Category and Issue Type. Specific staff users can be set for each category and issue type. Based on users in the staff list. This list has all the staff users and assignment is done based on staff load or in round-robin fashion. Steps to configure auto assignment Auto assignment feature can be enabled in the configuration item in all Crow Canyon helpdesk applications. Go to application administration page -> Auto Assignment tab -> Click ‘Ticket Assignment’ tile and select ‘Auto-assign Staff Selection’ as per the requirement. Auto assign staff selection can happen in below ways: Issue Type or Category or Staff List : Select this option to auto assign Ticket with below priority order: If Ticket is created with an Issue Type and selected Issue Type has staff and team, then Ticket will be assigned to that staff and team. This will take the highest precedence. Else if selected Category has staff and team, then Ticket will be assigned based on the staff and team in the selected Category. This will take the second highest precedence. Else if selected category doesn’t have designated staff and team, then Ticket will be assigned based on the users in the “Staff” list. 2. Issue Type or Category : Select this option if “Staff” list is not to be used and only assign based on the selected Issue Type and Category. 3. Staff List: Select this option to auto assign Ticket only based on the users in the “Staff” list. 4. None : Select this option to disable the auto assignment feature. Auto-assign Mode : Selection of staff user for auto-assignment can be done in below ways: Round Robin : By default, this option is selected. Staff will be assigned in round robin fashion. Multiple users can be specified in the Category and Issue Type items. For example, ‘VPN Access’ category has “John Smith“ and “Joe Bloggs” in the Assigned Staff column. First Ticket created with this category will be auto assigned to “John Smith”. Second Ticket created with this category will be auto assigned to “Joe Bloggs” and the cycle will repeat. Load Balance: Select this option to auto assign the Tickets to the staff user with lowest number of assigned active Tickets. This count is maintained by the application in the ‘Staff’ list. Maintain users in “Staff” list. Staff list has “Tickets Count” and this count will be updated whenever Ticket gets assigned to a staff. For example, “John Smith” has 5 Tickets and “Joe Bloggs” has 3 Tickets. If Ticket is created, then it will be assigned to “Joe Bloggs”. Configure staff in Category, Issue Type or Staff list: Category To specify the staff and team in Category, go to Application Administration -> Categorization tab -> Edit the Category -> Specify the “Assigned Team” and “Assigned Staff”. Issue Type To specify the staff and team in Issue Type, go to Application Administration -> Categorization tab -> Edit the Issue Type -> Specify the “Assigned Team” and “Assigned Staff”. Staff List To create the users in staff list, go to Application Administration -> Auto Assignment tab -> Create users in “Staff” list. Staff : Specify title for staff user. Staff Name : Ticket will be assigned to the user specified in this column. Tickets Count : This value is zero in the beginning. It will be increased by 1 whenever a Ticket is assigned to that user. User with lowest Tickets count will be assigned the next Ticket (if load balance option is selected). Is Active? : Staff can be marked as inactive if they are on leave or cannot work on Tickets for any other reason. Inactive staff will not be considered for auto-assignment. Is Next Staff? : This is used for round-robin assignment and is used by the application to select the next staff for assignment. Please do not modify the value of this column. Override team and staff on Category and Issue Type change Ticket is auto assigned and modified the category/Issue Type on Ticket update, enable override feature to reassign the Staff and Team as per the selected category/Issue Type. To override the staff and team on Category and Issue Type change, go to application administration page -> Auto Assignment tab -> click ‘Ticket Assignment’ tile -> Enable “Override Team” and “Override Assigned Staff”. Auto-assignment behavior If Ticket is already resolved or closed, then auto-assignment is not done. For example, if Ticket does not have a staff set, and it is categorized while being resolved, application will not auto-assign at this stage. If Ticket is auto assigned by application, and Ticket status is not equal to ‘Unassigned’, then status is not changed by the application. Ticket status is changed to ‘Assigne"

Categories are used to organize the Tickets. Using artificial intelligence (AI) Tickets can be auto categorized based on the Ticket’s subject and description. By analysing the Ticket’s subject and description, AI identifies the best match from predefined list of issue types/categories, simplifying Ticket management. This article describes the instructions to use artificial intelligence in Crow Canyon helpdesk applications in SharePoint online. Ticket classification process using AI : When a Ticket is created (either manually or via email), the system extracts key phrases from its subject and description. AI compares these phrases with the descriptions in the category/issue type list. Using embeddings, the AI calculates the semantic similarity between the Ticket’s text and the description in the category/issue type list, selecting the best match. If necessary, the AI recalculates embeddings to ensure up-to-date matching. Summary of steps : List schema NITRO form changes Configure AI settings Auto categorization process Other methods to auto set Category and Issue Type in a Ticket Detailed Steps: List Schema: Create columns below lists with the internal names and display names given below: Category/Issue Type list: Create below columns in “Category” and “Issue Type” lists. Go to the helpdesk site -> Administration page -> Configure lists -> Category/Issue Type -> List Settings -> Create below columns: Column Internal Name Column Display Name Column Type Embedding Embedding Multiple lines of text (Plain Text) Checksum Checksum Single line of text Description Description Multiple lines of text (Rich Text) Embedding : A “Multiple lines of text” column to store AI-generated embeddings, which are numerical representations of text meaning. Checksum: A “Single line of text” column used to track any changes in data. Description: A “Multiple lines of text” column where you provide description for issue type/category. Configurations Create below columns in ‘Configurations’ list. Go to the helpdesk application -> Administration page -> Configure lists -> Configurations -> Create below columns: Column Internal Name Column Dispaly Name Column Type AISettingsJSON AISettingsJSON Multiple lines of text (Plain Text) NITRO Form Changes Add above created columns to the NITRO forms. Category/Issue Type list: Add “Description” column to the NITRO forms and publish the forms. Go to the Category/Issue Type lists -> List Settings -> Crow Canyon NITRO Forms -> add ‘Description’ column to the form and publish NITRO forms. Specify the category/issue type details in ‘Description’ column for the issue type/category. This helps AI to understand and classify Tickets based on their content. Configurations list: Create a new tab ‘AI Connection Settings’ and add ‘AISettingsJSON’ column to this tab Go to the ‘Configurations’ list -> List Settings -> Crow Canyon NITRO Forms ->Create new tab ‘AI Connection Settings’ and ‘AISettingsJSON’ to the form and publish NITRO forms. Configure AI Settings Configure AI settings in ‘General Configurations’ in helpdesk applications. Go to application administration -> General Configurations tab -> Click ‘General Configurations’ tile -> ‘AI Connection Settings’ -> Specify below JSON settings in the ‘AISettingsJSON’ column. This JSON tells the system how to use AI for Ticket classification. Enter below JSON in AISettingsJSON { “AIConnection” : “Azure Open AI”, “AutoPopulateIssueType” : { “Enabled”:true, “EmbeddingColumn”:”Embedding”, “ChecksumColumn”:”Checksum”, “CalculateEmbeddings”:true, “DescriptionColumn” : “Description”, “RefinerString” : “” } } AIConnection : Specifies the AI service (in this case, Azure Open AI) name configured in the Crow Canyon NITRO Site Settings. If AI connection is not configured, application will use SharePoint search to find the matching category/issue type. However, for proper matching, it is recommended that AI settings are configured.

    "text": " NITRO Studio Report Error Feature NITRO Studio Report Error Feature 286 views 3 min , 2 sec read 0 Applies To SharePoint Online Description: NITRO Studio components provide a variety of features for configuring business process flows in SharePoint. Sometimes an error can occur during execution due to various reasons like invalid configurations or data, intermittent connectivity or Office 365 issues, NITRO issues etc. NITRO Custom Actions component has a feature to log details of error and related data in a list in the site. This data can be used by administrators to investigate the issue and correct the configurations. For NITRO issues, these can be submitted by administrators to Crow Canyon for further investigation and fixes as required. This feature will be added to other NITRO components in upcoming releases. This article describes the process of submitting these errors and investigation thereafter. When an error is detected by NITRO, logged-in user is shown an option to report the error.  Site administrator (Full Control) will get a notification along with link to the details of the error. Note: This feature is available in NITRO 2.x and is already included as part of the NITRO Applications package. It will be made available soon in NITRO 3.x. Summary of steps: Install NITRO Extensions setup Report Error to administrator Report Error to Crow Canyon Detailed Steps: 1. Install NITRO Extensions setup Step 1: Navigate to root site of the site collection -> Crow Canyon NITRO Studio app -> click on NITRO Applications as shown below: Please go to Updates tab in NITRO Applications -> click on NITRO Extensions as shown below Select the required NITRO site and click Ok to finish the setup as shown below. Once the above setup is complete, a new list called “NITROErrorLog” will be created in the site. This list helps track all errors reported by users. The Application administrator can use it to monitor and manage issues. A workflow can also be set up to send automatic notifications when a new item is created. After the issue is resolved—either by the administrator or Crow Canyon Support—it can be marked as Completed . The list includes columns to capture detailed error information and comes with pre-configured actions for administrators to manage and respond to issues efficiently. To access the list, please go to Site Contents -> NITROErrorLog – If the administrator wants to get notification, they can configure the workflow on NITROErrorLog list when the item is created. This workflow creation to get notification is an optional step. Go to site settings -> Administration -> Crow Canyon NITRO Apps -> Crow Canyon NITRO Workflows app -> Create a new workflow on NITROErrorLog list on item added event to notify administrator. 2. Report Error to administrator When any error in encountered during custom action execution, a link to submit the error details is shown to user: On clicking this link a popup is shown with below options: – After the report is submitted, a message is shown to user as shown in the screenshot below. Error details along with optional information is created as an item in the ‘NITROErrorLog’ list. 3. Report Error to Crow Canyon Users with Site Administration (Full Control) permission can take the following actions on error log items: Send to Crow Canyon Mark Completed These actions are created by the Application in the ‘NITROErrorLog’ list. Administrators can navigate to the item from the notification (as configured in Step 2 above), review details, and decide the next steps whether to “Send to Crow Canyon” or work on it and “Mark Completed”. If error was temporary or fixed by configuration changes, administrator can mark the item as ‘Completed’. If the error is consistent and the administrator is not able to find the root cause, request assistance by using the ‘Send to Crow Canyon’ action. The error details will then be sent to the Crow Canyon support team. These actions can be updated as required. Custom Action Functionality Send to Crow Canyon This custom action is used to escalate an error to Crow Canyon Support when the issue is in a “Pending” state. Functionality: Condition: The action runs only if the item’s status is set to “Pending” . It is available to all users. Update Work Log: A pop-up opens for the administrator to add a comment or note in the Work Log field to provide context or details about the issue. Here you can describe the steps already tried and whether the issue is consistent across users/browsers, etc. You can also include browser console logs/network traces during the issue. Send Email to Crow Canyon: On clicking ‘Ok’, an email is automatically sent to Crow Canyon Support with the item’s error details. Update Status: The item’s status is updated from “ Pending “ to “ Sent to Crow Canyon “ to indicate escalation. Mark Completed This custom action is used when the issue has been reviewed and resolved, either by the administrator or by the Crow Canyon support team. Functionali"

The configuration steps are explained in reference to the below use cases: Show all the tabs along with the ‘Next’ and ‘Previous’ buttons. Hide all the tabs and show only the ‘Next and ‘Previous’ buttons. Detailed steps ‘Tickets’ list is taken as an example in this article. The ‘Script Action’ buttons are added in all the tabs of the NITRO Form as specified below: One ‘Script Action’ button in the first tab (‘Employee’) to configure ‘Next’ button. Two ‘Script Action’ buttons in second, third and fourth tabs (‘Staff’, ‘Work Log’ and ‘Knowledge Base’) to configure ‘Next’ and ‘Previous’ buttons. One ‘Script Action’ button in the last tab (‘Related Items’) to configure ‘Previous’ button. Use Case 1: Show all the tabs along with the ‘Next’ and ‘Previous’ buttons. To configure ‘Next’ button, navigate to NITRO Forms designer for the ‘Tickets’ list -> Expand ‘Actions’ section from right-hand panel -> Drag and drop ‘Script Action’ button on the ‘Employee’ tab. 2. Select the ‘Script Action’ button -> Specify button title as ‘Next’ -> Click ‘Edit’ button beside ‘Process’. 3. In the opened window specify the JavaScript for ‘Next’ button as shown below: Script: formContext.showNextTabORSection(false,true); functionCallback(false); 4. For ‘Staff’ tab, drag and drop two ‘Script Action’ buttons to configure the ‘Next’ and ‘Previous’ buttons. Note: Configuration for ‘Next’ button is same as described in the above steps. 5. JavaScript for the ‘Previous’ button is as shown below: Script: formContext.showPreviousTabORSection(true); functionCallback(false); Similarly, configure ‘Previous’ and ‘Next’ buttons in other tabs. 6. Publish the NITRO Forms. Sample output Use Case 2: Hide all the tabs and show only the ‘Next’ and ‘Previous’ buttons. This is useful for configuring submission wizard. In wizard mode, user is presented a series of pages in a sequence to enter the data. On the last page, there is a form to submit the request. User can click previous/back buttons on intermediate pages to navigate to different pages. Using Crow Canyon NITRO Forms, this experience can be easily configured. For this use case, the ‘Script Action’ buttons can be configured as explained in ‘Use Case 1’. However, to hide the tabs, the script for the ‘Next’ and ‘Previous’ buttons is different. For the ‘Next’ button, the JavaScript used is as shown below: Script: formContext.showNextTabORSection(); functionCallback(); 2. For the ‘Previous’ button, the script used is as shown below: Script: formContext.showPreviousTabORSection(); functionCallback(); Note: Configure ‘Next’ and ‘Previous’ buttons in all the tabs as needed. 3. Specify ‘Custom JavaScript’, expand ‘Advanced’ section from the left-hand panel -> click Custom JavaScript Script: formContext.hideAllTabsORSections(); 4. Publish the NITRO Forms. Sample output In this case, on clicking the ‘Next’ button to navigate to the next tab, the previous tab is hidden and only the current tab is visible, as shown in the above screenshot. On clicking the ‘Next’ button in the ‘Employee’ tab, the ‘Staff’ tab is visible and the ‘Employee’ tab is hidden. Note: All the required columns must be filled before switching between the tabs.

For reference, this configuration is implemented on ‘Tickets’ and ‘Email Tickets’ lists of the Helpdesk Application using NITRO Workflows. The objective of such a configuration is to exclude some users from the application’s notification emails based on a specific domain when a ticket is created either from an email or through the backend/portal site. Note: It is not necessary to use domain for the filter criteria. Any keyword can be used as needed. Detailed s teps To configure a custom notification system, it is required to first disable the standard notifications that are already configured in the application. To disable the default notification system, navigate to the Helpdesk application -> ‘Administration’ from the top link bar -> ‘Notifications’ from the quick launch -> Click ‘Notification on Ticket Creation’ as shown below: 2. Unselect ‘Notify Requester’ column -> Save the settings. 3.

These agreements can be formal or informal. Web level settings for SLAs applies to all the SLAs. For example: Setting up of business days and business hours will apply for calculation of time for all the SLAs List Level settings for SLAs are configurable options applied to each SLA that define various attributes of SLA like priority, due date, request status etc. In the context of ITSM (IT Service Management), SLAs help set and manage the expectations of end users when they raise a request or report an incident. In IT service desks, SLAs are primarily used to define the time it takes for services to be delivered and incidents to be resolved. SLA feature is now added in Crow Canyon IT helpdesk applications. This article is useful for configuring the SLA feature in standard IT helpdesk applications. SLA Configurations Navigation Go to Application Administration -> Service Level Agreements Tab -> Click SLA tile, this will open the SLA configuration page as shown below: New Policy: Click this button to create new SLA Policy. Change Priority Order: Click this button to change the priority of SLA policies in case of multiple SLA. List Level settings: Click this button to configure List level settings for SLA. Web Level settings: Click this button to configure web level settings for SLA. Web Level Settings Web Level Settings in SLA determine the business hours during which SLAs are applied and calculated. These settings ensure that SLA timers only run during specified working hours, preventing unnecessary breaches due to non-working hours. There are two ways to configure Web Level Settings: Site Regional Settings: By default, Web Level Settings are automatically populated based on the site’s regional settings. This ensures consistency across the system. If users need to make adjustments, they must navigate to the Site Regional Settings and modify the working hours there. Custom Settings: If users prefer more control, they can override the default settings and define their own work week directly within Web Level Settings. This allows them to customize working days and hours as per specific business needs. Once these settings are updated, SLAs will be applied according to the newly configured schedule. Site Regional Settings: Custom Settings: List Level Settings List Level Settings are used to set various conditions for the SLA like priority, due date, request status etc. These settings can be configured for list level as shown below: Priority Column : This dropdown will show all choice type of columns from Tickets list. SLA policies will be configured based on the selected priority column. In this sample use case, we have configured ‘Priority’ column from Tickets list. Below are the options in ‘Priority’ column in Tickets list. Low Normal High Due Date Column : This dropdown will show all date and time type of columns from Tickets list. Resolution due date will be updated in the selected column in this dropdown. In this sample use case, resolution due date will be updated in ‘Due Date’ column in the Tickets list. Resolution Due Hours Column : This dropdown will show all number type of columns from Tickets list. We can use this column to override the resolution hours specified in the SLA policy when calculating the resolution due date. Note : Value specified in this column will be considered as hours. If we specify value in the selected column in the Ticket then ‘Due Date’ will be calculated based on the hours specified in this column by overriding the resolution hours configured in the SLA policy, otherwise it will consider the resolution hours specified in the SLA policy. Calculate SLA Using : SLA will be calculated in below ways: Calendar Time Business Time Calendar Time : Selecting this option will calculate the SLA in 24×7 format. Business Time : Selecting this option will calculate the SLA as per business time settings configured in web level settings in SLA.               Holiday List: Select a custom list which is used to maintain all holidays in this list.               Holiday Date Column : Select date column from above selected list.

This feature provides a visual representation of workflow stages, making it easier for users to track the current status of a request. The choice bar dynamically updates based on the selected column value and can be customized in terms of choice options, color, design, etc. Use Cases IT Change Request Workflow Scenario: In an IT Change Management system, a request goes through multiple stages before approval. A visual choice bar helps users track the current status of the request. Configured statuses: Draft → Pending Approval → In Progress → Completed → Closed The status dynamically updates as the request moves through these stages.   Example: A user submits a change request. Initially, the status is “Draft”. After submission, it changes to “Pending Approval”. The choice bar updates dynamically in the form based on the ‘Status’ column value. HR Employee Onboarding Process Scenario: The HR department tracks new employee onboarding process. Choice bar helps HR identify at which stage the employee has reached.   Configured statuses: Application Received → Background Check → Offer Sent → Onboarding → Completed Example: A recruiter updates the ‘Onboarding Status’ field, and the form displays the corresponding step highlighted in the choice bar. Ticket Status in Helpdesk Application Scenario: Tracking Ticket status in IT Helpdesk Helpdesk system receives tickets for IT issues. Users want to track the progress of their Ticket in a clear and visual manner. Configured statuses for Ticket workflow: Unassigned → Assigned → On Hold → Waiting on Requester → Resolved → Closed Example: Requester raises an IT support ticket. Initially, the status is “Unassigned”. When Ticket is assigned to IT staff, the status changes to “Assigned”, and the choice bar updates dynamically. If additional information is needed, the status moves to “Waiting on Requester”, then “Resolved”, when the Ticket is resolved by IT staff, and finally “Closed”. Configuration steps for choice bar in the helpdesk application Open NITRO Forms designer for the required list. Here it is ‘Ticket’ list. Go to the Helpdesk application -> Administration -> Configure Lists -> ‘Configure Tickets’ -> Crow Canyon NITRO Forms -> Edit the ‘Tickets’ form à Expand ‘Form Controls’ section from the left-hand panel -> Drag and drop ‘Choice Bar’ on top of the form.

Table header: Values specified for table header: For “RowStyles”: height: 70px: This value sets the height of header row to 70 pixels. For “CellStyles”: padding: 10px: This value applies 10 pixels of padding inside each cell, creating space between the cell content and the cell border. height: 50px: This value sets the height of each cell to 50 pixels. vertical-align: middle; text-align:center This value is used to place the content in centre within the container (both horizontally and vertically). Table row: Column width: Syntax : “Column internal name”: “width:100px;” Example : “LinkTitle”: “width:100px;” This value specifies width of the ‘Title’ column as 100 pixels to be displayed in the list view. Note: Refer to this article to get internal name of a list column. By default, the column width adjusts dynamically based on the cell contents. To prevent this behaviour and to enforce specified width of the column, ‘table-layout: fixed;’ can be specified in ‘TableStyles’ section as below: “TableStyles”: “background-color: #00bfff; width: 100%; text-align: right; border: 5px solid black; table-layout: fixed;” Output: Explanation for styling the rows individually: \"Rows\": { \"RowStyles\": \"background-color: #f0f0f0;\", \"CellStyles\": \"color:white;\" } “Rows”: This key defines the style that will be applied to the regular (non-header, non-alternate) rows of the table. “RowStyles”: This property can be used to style the entire row, such as background color, border, or height. Example: “RowStyles”: “background-color: #f0f0f0;”, background-color: #f0f0f0; This value sets (#f0f0f0 ) light grey background color for each row. “CellStyles”: “color: black;” This value is used to specify text color of the cells. It is black in this example. Sample output is shown below: Styling the alternate rows: \"AltRows\": { \"RowStyles\": \"background-color: coral;\", \"CellStyles\": \"color: wheat;\" } “AltRows”: This is used to style the alternate rows in a table. “RowStyles”: “background-color: #FFE4C4;”, This specifies CSS applied to the entire row.

For example, “Three Hundred Euros and Ten Cents” is written as 300,10 , with a comma serving as the decimal marker. In contrast, regions outside Europe commonly use decimal for the same amount, writing it as 300.10 . Based on this requirement, this article demonstrates the use of custom JavaScript within form event actions in NITRO Forms to dynamically format the entered amount according to the appropriate currency style. List schema Custom SharePoint list List columns: Column Display Name Column Internal Name Column Type Amount Amount Number Amount Type AmountType Choice  Choice options: US DollarEuroOther   Amount In Selected Currency AmountInSelectedCurrency Single line of text ‘Amount’ column settings: b. ‘Amount Type’ column settings: Users can select the desired currency format from this column. c. ‘Amount In Selected Currency’ column settings: The value in this column will be auto populated using form event actions. Detailed steps Configure a form event action in the NITRO Forms. Navigate to Crow Canyon NITRO Forms designer for the list -> Drag and drop all the above created columns onto the NITRO Form -> Expand ‘Advanced’ section -> Form Event Actions -> New Configuration as shown below: 2. Configure a FEA on form load and on column value change -> Select “Amount” and “Amount Type” columns from the drop down. 3. Configure “Update Form Controls” action -> Map “Amount In Selected Currency” column using custom JavaScript. The JavaScript used above is: var vFundsType = _ccs_FormUI.fetchColumnValueUI(\"AmountType\"); var vAmount = _ccs_FormUI.fetchColumnValueUI(\"Amount\"); var vACHTotal = \"\"; function format (locale, currency, number) { return new Intl.NumberFormat(locale, { style: 'currency', currency, currencyDisplay: \"code\" }) .format(number) .replace(currency, \"\") .trim(); } if(vFundsType == \"Euro\"){ vACHTotal = format('de-DE', 'EUR', vAmount); // 123.456,79 } else { vACHTotal = format('en-US', 'USD', vAmount); //vACHTotal = format('ja-JP', 'JPY', vAmount); // 123,457 } return vACHTotal; Note: Specify internal name of ‘Amount’ and ‘AmountType’ columns in the script. Refer to this article to get internal name of a list column. The script is designed in a way that if the “Amount Type” column is set to “Euro,” the value in the “Amount In Selected Currency” column will be formatted according to the German locale. For the “US” option, the value will be formatted in the US locale. If the selected option is “Other,” the value will be formatted using the default locale. 4. Save the above configured Form Event Action and publish the NITRO Forms. Sample output: Based on the above configuration, sample output for different currency types is as shown below: For “Amount Type” set to “ US Dollars”: For “Amount Type” set to “Euros”: For “Amount Type” set to “Other”: “Other” option formats the ‘Amount’ column value using the default format based on site’s regional settings.

This can be achieved using form event actions in NITRO Forms. Sample use case: The configuration explained in this article is performed based on the following scenario: When the ‘Project’ column value (which is a NITRO lookup column) is selected, then the value in ‘Max People Allowed’ column is automatically filled as per the auto-fill lookup data column mappings. When users are selected in the ‘People’ column, the count of these users is automatically filled in ‘People Count’ column using first Form Event Action. The value in ‘People Count’ column is then matched with the value in ‘Max People Allowed’ column using custom JavaScript. Based on the conditions specified in custom JavaScript, background colour of the ‘People Count’ column is changed to Red, Green, or Yellow, using custom JavaScript that is configured in the second Form Event Action. Validation is configured on the ‘People’ column that checks if ‘People Count’ column value matches with the value in ‘Max People Allowed’ column. If the validation fails, the form cannot be submitted. List schema Custom SharePoint list.

The length of the string exceeds the value set on the maxJsonLength property.”   Cause This error occurs when the amount of data being serialized into a JSON string by the JavaScriptSerializer exceeds its default or configured maxJsonLength limit. (SharePoint uses JavaScriptSerializer to communicate data between the server and the client by facilitating the exchange of data in JSON format.) Resolution Increase ‘MaxJsonLength’ property to its maximum value for the SharePoint web application. Refer to this article for details. Note: The maximum characters allowed in JSON output are 2,097,152 (2 MB). If even after performing the steps mentioned in above article does not resolve the issue, then it means that the data in lookup column exceeds the maximum limit permitted in the web application. In such a case, below solutions can be performed: Solution 1: Perform the archival functionality in any Crow Canyon Application: Archival feature moves old list items to the corresponding archived lists. This feature if not enabled by default, can be configured by referring to the below article: Archival functionality in Crow Canyon Application – Crow Canyon Software Support Solution 2 : As a workaround, hide the lookup column (containing large data) in default ‘Content Type’ of the list. To hide the lookup column in a content type, navigate to the list -> List settings -> Advanced Settings -> Select ‘Yes’ for ‘Allow management of content types?’ -> Click ‘Ok’ to save the settings. On the list settings page, click the default content type. ‘Item’ is the default content type in this example. In the opened page, select the lookup column (that has large data) -> select the option ‘Hidden (Will not appear in the forms)’ -> Click ‘Ok’. Solution 3: Upgrade to Crow Canyon NITRO Studio.

In Crow Canyon applications, this error typically occurs if automated process (like NITRO Workflows, Crow Canyon Product App, etc.) updates the system-managed columns (such as Case ID, SLA fields, etc.) at the same time when a user is editing that item manually. To handle and avoid such conflicts, NITRO Forms provide an advanced background monitoring feature. This feature ensures smoother user experience and conflict resolution. Steps to enable background monitoring in NITRO Forms: Navigate to Application Administration → Configure Lists → Configure Tickets → Crow Canyon NITRO Forms → Manage Forms → Advanced Settings à Enable background monitoring settings as shown below: Under the ‘Background Item Update’ section, enable ‘Monitor item update in background’. Set an appropriate ‘Background update monitor interval’ (example, 10 seconds ): NITRO form will check for background updates made to an item as per this time interval. Form Reload : It has two options – 1. Manual: NITRO Form will be reloaded by the user manually. Below setting is visible if this option is selected: – ‘Allow overwriting background update changes’: If this setting is enabled, then in case of an update to item by another user or process in background, current user is allowed to overwrite with their changes to the NITRO Form. 2. Automatic: If this option is selected, then the changes will be applied to an item automatically based on the selected reload option. ‘Reload Option’ has three options: – Keep Background Changes: For columns modified by user and also by background update, column value will be set as per changes done in background update. For columns modified only by user or only by background save, latest value will be set. – Keep User Changes: For columns modified by user and also by background update, column value will be set as per user changes. For columns modified only by user or only by background save, latest value will be set. – Discard User Changes: All changes done by user on the form will be discarded and item will be reloaded as per changes done in the background save. Publish the NITRO Forms. Conflict resolution options displayed to users: When version conflict occurs, NITRO Forms will prompt the user with following action buttons to resolve the update: Discard my changes → The changes made by current user will be discarded. Item will reload with the most recent updates from other user/background process. Keep my changes → If two users or current user and automated process modified the same columns, the current user’s changes will be saved. All other columns will be updated with the latest values. Keep background changes → If two users or current user and automated process modified the same columns, the other user’s (background) changes will be kept. All other columns will reflect the latest values. Enabling background item monitoring helps avoid version conflict error in NITRO Forms proactively. It ensures better user collaboration and prevents data loss. Example with manual form load: Settings for ‘Background Item Update’: Selected manual form reload. Joe Bloggs updates and saves the item while John Smith is attempting to make changes at the same time. As a result, the following version conflict error message is displayed to John Smith. Clicking the ‘Reload’ option will present John Smith with three choices to manually reload the form based on the selected option as shown below. If John Smith selects “ Keep background changes “, then background changes will be applied to the column values that were modified by John Smith and by the background process. If John Smith selects “ Keep my changes ” option, then the column values updated by John Smith will be set for the columns updated by both the users and Joe Bloggs’ changes will be discarded. For columns updated only by John Smith and only by Joe Bloggs, latest values will be set. If John Smith selects “ Discard my changes ” option, then the column values updated by Joe Bloggs will be set. All the changes made by John Smith will be discarded.

These logs are very useful for troubleshooting. Execution logs for a workflow can be accessed from: Logs Button CCSWFHistory_ListName_Number (Selected workflow execution history list) CCSWFHistory_ListName_Common (Common workflow execution history list) This article describes the following about workflow execution history lists: Enable execution logs for the workflows Workflow execution history lists Reusing same history list for multiple workflows on a list Navigating to workflow execution history list Managing items in this list Enable execution logs for the workflows To enable execution logs for a workflow: Navigate to the site -> Site settings -> Site Administration -> ‘Crow Canyon NITRO Apps’ -> ‘NITRO Workflows’ -> Edit the required workflow and scroll down to “Workflow execution history settings” section. Select “Enable execution history” and choose the history list from “Select history list” drop-down. Execution history logs can be enabled while configuring a new workflow or by editing an existing workflow. Workflow execution history lists Enabling execution history for a workflow will create two workflow execution history lists in the site. CCSWFHistory_Tickets_1 CCSWFHistory_Tickets_Common Note: In this article, execution history is enabled for the workflows that are configured on the Tickets list. CCSWFHistory_Tickets_1 It is the main workflow execution history list. All the detailed execution logs are created in this list when a workflow is executed. Users can debug the workflows by reading the debug log and execution logs created in this list. There can be different history lists for workflows configured on the same list. CCSWFHistory_Tickets_Common It is a common logs list that is created to store execution history of all the workflows configured on the Tickets list. There is only one common workflow execution history list that gets created for a list. Difference between a specific logs list and common logs list In common logs list, after its creation, logs for all the workflows configured for a list are saved, even though some workflows configured on that list have not enabled execution history. The specific logs list, selected in workflow execution history settings, store detailed logs for that workflow. Both the lists are useful for checking workflow logs. For example, there are four workflows configured on a list, only two of them have enabled execution history. The common logs list store logs for all four workflows, whereas specific logs list store logs for those two workflows that have enabled the execution history. Columns used in both the workflow execution history lists: Title: The item title is displayed as ‘Workflow Name – Item ID – Workflow Status’. Workflow Name: Name of the workflow Item ID: Specifies item id on which the workflow is executed Workflow Status: Specifies execution status of the current workflow. Item: This is the lookup column pointing to that item on main list on which the workflow is executed. Status: Specifies the status of workflow execution. Below are the possible status options. Success: Represents that the workflow executed successfully. Fail: Represents that the workflow execution failed. Flow Name: Name of the workflow. Flow ID: Specifies Id of the workflow. Event Type: Event on which the workflow has been triggered. Example, timer based, item added, etc. Event Trigger: ‘Event triggered by’ related information is stored in this column. An event can be triggered by the logged in user or by an automated process. Start Time: The time when workflow execution begins. End Time: The time when workflow execution completes. Executed By: By whom is this workflow executed. This column contains logged in username for the event-based workflows, if it is a timer-based workflow then this column is left blank and if the workflow is executed by automated process, then it contains ‘SharePoint App’. Execution Log: This column contains execution logs for the workflow. It contains brief information about the workflow such as ‘Workflow ID’, ‘Name’, ‘List’, ‘Workflow Status’, etc. Debug Log: This column contains detailed logs for the workflow and are useful for troubleshooting. Reusing same history list for multiple workflows on a list It is possible to reuse same history list to store logs for multiple workflows configure on the same SP list. All the history lists for that list are available in “Select history list” drop-down along with the new list.

It converts words or sentences into floating-point numbers so that computers can understand and compare their meanings. Embeddings are especially useful during search. When a user types a query, the system calculates the embedding for that query and compares it with the embeddings of Knowledge Base (KB) articles. If the distance between them is small, it means the meanings are similar. The closer the match, the higher the article ranks in the results. In NITRO Helpdesk, we use Custom Actions to: Calculate the embedding for each KB article. Store this embedding in a column in the KB list.

Pre-requisites: Users generally need an Azure subscription to set up and use Azure services. User needs permission to create Azure resources and to deploy models for Azure Open AI. Please refer below article to create Azure Services: Instructions to create Azure Services – Crow Canyon Software Support Copilot can work with different data sources; prerequisites vary based on the type of data source that is used to generate the answers. Please refer below article to set up Document Intelligence Connection. AI Connection Settings in NITRO Site Settings – Crow Canyon Software Support Configuration of Document Intelligence Action List used: ‘Knowledge Base’ list in Helpdesk application Knowledge Base’ list stores all the documents. Document Intelligence action is required to extract the content of the documents and save them in a target location. Target location can be ‘Current Item’, ‘Variable’, ‘Azure AI Search’ or a’ SharePoint List’. The following Custom Action is configured on the ‘Knowledge Base’ list in the NITRO Helpdesk application Navigate to Helpdesk Application -> Application Administration in Top Link bar -> Advanced Section in left side -> Crow Canyon NITRO Apps -> Crow Canyon NITRO Studio -> Click Custom Actions -> Select list -> Drag and drop Document Intelligence custom action under Actions section to the designer part Action settings: General Settings: Enter an action name and select execution status whether to show or hide this action from user during execution. This does not affect action execution, it only changes the visibility to the user. Content Settings:               Operations: Add/Update Content :This option adds/Update the content from Knowledge Base list in target location for the copilot Remove Content: This option removes the content so that content is not used in copilot.               Content Source: Select the source of the content, either a document or any multi-line text column. If custom action is configured on a custom list, it will ask for a file name for the document option. Content Columns : One or more columns selected for processing and indexing. Strip HTML : Option to remove HTML tags from column content before processing. Document Intelligence Settings: AI Connection: Select the Document Intelligence connection configured in NITRO Site Settings. If no connection is configured yet, click the plus ‘+’ icon to configure one. This column will be visible only when Content Source is selected as ‘Document’ in Content Settings section.               Split Document: select ‘yes’ if you want to split the document. The ‘Chunk Size’ and ‘Chunk Overlap’ columns will be visible if the split document is selected.               Chunk Size: The entered number will show the maximum number of characters in each chunk of the document after splitting.               Chunk Overlap: It determines how much chunks overlap with each other. It is used to give continuity and preserve the meaning of text in the chunks. Target Settings: Select Target: Choose where the data extracted from the documents should be stored.                            Current Item: Use this option to extract the content from the document and put it in some multi-line text column of the current item for later use. This option will be disabled in the case of the Split Document option because it is not possible to store multiple document data in single target column. In current item, we can store data from one document in target column. Creating multiple columns to store multiple documents data is not a valid option as the target ‘Text column’ doesn’t support the selection of multiple columns.                            Set in Variable: This option can be used in scenarios where the user wants to extract the data from the document and store it in a variable. The variable can then be used for example to send data by email by send mail action template. This option will be disabled in the case of the Split Document option.                            Azure AI Search: Use this option to store the data extracted from documents in Azure AI Search as an index. When a user makes a query, NITRO copilot will use the index to give more relevant results.                            SharePoint List: Use this option to store the data extracted from a document in a multi-line text column of a list.               Embeddings AI Connection: Select the Embeddings AI connection configured in NITRO Site Settings. If no connection is configured yet, click the plus ‘+’ icon to configure one.               Azure AI Search Connection: Select the Azure AI Search connection configured in NITRO Site Settings.

If they move the cursor to another field then back to the first field, they can then begin typing. This doesn’t happen in Firefox but the enterprise is set up with Internet Explorer and IE users have to do this with every ticket. SOLUTION: For this we have work around as mentioned below. a. Go to List Settings for the Ticket list b. Create a dummy field (column) in ticket list. Name can be “Dummy Field” and it is a field type of “Single line of text” 3. Make the newly created Dummy Field as first column as mentioned below. Click on Item content type. Click on Column order Change “position from top” for Dummy field to 1 "
